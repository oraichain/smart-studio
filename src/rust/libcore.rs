//! # The Rust Core Library
//!
//! The Rust Core Library is the dependency-free[^free] foundation of [The
//! Rust Standard Library](../std/index.html). It is the portable glue
//! between the language and its libraries, defining the intrinsic and
//! primitive building blocks of all Rust code. It links to no
//! upstream libraries, no system libraries, and no libc.
//!
//! [^free]: Strictly speaking, there are some symbols which are needed but
//!          they aren't always necessary.
//!
//! The core library is *minimal*: it isn't even aware of heap allocation,
//! nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require
//! platform integration, and this library is platform-agnostic.
//!
//! # How to use the core library
//!
//! Please note that all of these details are currently not considered stable.
//!
// FIXME: Fill me in with more detail when the interface settles
//! This library is built on the assumption of a few existing symbols:
//!
//! * `memcpy`, `memcmp`, `memset`, `strlen` - These are core memory routines which are
//!   often generated by LLVM. Additionally, this library can make explicit
//!   calls to these functions. Their signatures are the same as found in C.
//!   These functions are often provided by the system libc, but can also be
//!   provided by the [compiler-builtins crate](https://crates.io/crates/compiler_builtins).
//!
//! * `rust_begin_panic` - This function takes four arguments, a
//!   `fmt::Arguments`, a `&'static str`, and two `u32`'s. These four arguments
//!   dictate the panic message, the file at which panic was invoked, and the
//!   line and column inside the file. It is up to consumers of this core
//!   library to define this panic function; it is only required to never
//!   return. This requires a `lang` attribute named `panic_impl`.
//!
//! * `rust_eh_personality` - is used by the failure mechanisms of the
//!    compiler. This is often mapped to GCC's personality function, but crates
//!    which do not trigger a panic can be assured that this function is never
//!    called. The `lang` attribute is called `eh_personality`.

// Since libcore defines many fundamental lang items, all tests live in a
// separate crate, libcoretest, to avoid bizarre issues.
//
// Here we explicitly #[cfg]-out this whole crate when testing. If we don't do
// this, both the generated test artifact and the linked libtest (which
// transitively includes libcore) will both define the same set of lang items,
// and this will cause the E0152 "found duplicate lang item" error. See
// discussion in #50466 for details.
//
// This cfg won't affect doc tests.
#![cfg(not(test))]
// To run libcore tests without x.py without ending up with two copies of libcore, Miri needs to be
// able to "empty" this crate. See <https://github.com/rust-lang/miri-test-libstd/issues/4>.
// rustc itself never sets the feature, so this line has no affect there.

//! Converting decimal strings into IEEE 754 binary floating point numbers.
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! We are given a decimal string such as `12.34e56`. This string consists of integral (`12`),
//! fractional (`34`), and exponent (`56`) parts. All parts are optional and interpreted as zero
//! when missing.
//!
//! We seek the IEEE 754 floating point number that is closest to the exact value of the decimal
//! string. It is well-known that many decimal strings do not have terminating representations in
//! base two, so we round to 0.5 units in the last place (in other words, as well as possible).
//! Ties, decimal values exactly half-way between two consecutive floats, are resolved with the
//! half-to-even strategy, also known as banker's rounding.
//!
//! Needless to say, this is quite hard, both in terms of implementation complexity and in terms
//! of CPU cycles taken.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! First, we ignore signs. Or rather, we remove it at the very beginning of the conversion
//! process and re-apply it at the very end. This is correct in all edge cases since IEEE
//! floats are symmetric around zero, negating one simply flips the first bit.
//!
//! Then we remove the decimal point by adjusting the exponent: Conceptually, `12.34e56` turns
//! into `1234e54`, which we describe with a positive integer `f = 1234` and an integer `e = 54`.
//! The `(f, e)` representation is used by almost all code past the parsing stage.
//!
//! We then try a long chain of progressively more general and expensive special cases using
//! machine-sized integers and small, fixed-sized floating point numbers (first `f32`/`f64`, then
//! a type with 64 bit significand). The extended-precision algorithm
//! uses the Eisel-Lemire algorithm, which uses a 128-bit (or 192-bit)
//! representation that can accurately and quickly compute the vast majority
//! of floats. When all these fail, we bite the bullet and resort to using
//! a large-decimal representation, shifting the digits into range, calculating
//! the upper significant bits and exactly round to the nearest representation.
//!
//! Another aspect that needs attention is the ``RawFloat`` trait by which almost all functions
//! are parametrized. One might think that it's enough to parse to `f64` and cast the result to
//! `f32`. Unfortunately this is not the world we live in, and this has nothing to do with using
//! base two or half-to-even rounding.
//!
//! Consider for example two types `d2` and `d4` representing a decimal type with two decimal
//! digits and four decimal digits each and take "0.01499" as input. Let's use half-up rounding.
//! Going directly to two decimal digits gives `0.01`, but if we round to four digits first,
//! we get `0.0150`, which is then rounded up to `0.02`. The same principle applies to other
//! operations as well, if you want 0.5 ULP accuracy you need to do *everything* in full precision
//! and round *exactly once, at the end*, by considering all truncated bits at once.
//!
//! Primarily, this module and its children implement the algorithms described in:
//! "Number Parsing at a Gigabyte per Second", available online:
//! <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11408>.
//!
//! # Other
//!
//! The conversion should *never* panic. There are assertions and explicit panics in the code,
//! but they should never be triggered and only serve as internal sanity checks. Any panics should
//! be considered a bug.
//!
//! There are unit tests but they are woefully inadequate at ensuring correctness, they only cover
//! a small percentage of possible errors. Far more extensive tests are located in the directory
//! `src/etc/test-float-parse` as a Python script.
//!
//! A note on integer overflow: Many parts of this file perform arithmetic with the decimal
//! exponent `e`. Primarily, we shift the decimal point around: Before the first decimal digit,
//! after the last decimal digit, and so on. This could overflow if done carelessly. We rely on
//! the parsing submodule to only hand out sufficiently small exponents, where "sufficient" means
//! "such that the exponent +/- the number of decimal digits fits into a 64 bit integer".
//! Larger exponents are accepted, but we don't do arithmetic with them, they are immediately
//! turned into {positive,negative} {zero,infinity}.

Floating-point number to decimal conversion routines.

# Problem statement

We are given the floating-point number `v = f * 2^e` with an integer `f`,
and its bounds `minus` and `plus` such that any number between `v - minus` and
`v + plus` will be rounded to `v`. For the simplicity we assume that
this range is exclusive. Then we would like to get the unique decimal
representation `V = 0.d[0..n-1] * 10^k` such that:

- `d[0]` is non-zero.

- It's correctly rounded when parsed back: `v - minus < V < v + plus`.
  Furthermore it is shortest such one, i.e., there is no representation
  with less than `n` digits that is correctly rounded.

- It's closest to the original value: `abs(V - v) <= 10^(k-n) / 2`. Note that
  there might be two representations satisfying this uniqueness requirement,
  in which case some tie-breaking mechanism is used.

We will call this mode of operation as to the *shortest* mode. This mode is used
when there is no additional constraint, and can be thought as a "natural" mode
as it matches the ordinary intuition (it at least prints `0.1f32` as "0.1").

We have two more modes of operation closely related to each other. In these modes
we are given either the number of significant digits `n` or the last-digit
limitation `limit` (which determines the actual `n`), and we would like to get
the representation `V = 0.d[0..n-1] * 10^k` such that:

- `d[0]` is non-zero, unless `n` was zero in which case only `k` is returned.

- It's closest to the original value: `abs(V - v) <= 10^(k-n) / 2`. Again,
  there might be some tie-breaking mechanism.

When `limit` is given but not `n`, we set `n` such that `k - n = limit`
so that the last digit `d[n-1]` is scaled by `10^(k-n) = 10^limit`.
If such `n` is negative, we clip it to zero so that we will only get `k`.
We are also limited by the supplied buffer. This limitation is used to print
the number up to given number of fractional digits without knowing
the correct `k` beforehand.

We will call the mode of operation requiring `n` as to the *exact* mode,
and one requiring `limit` as to the *fixed* mode. The exact mode is a subset of
the fixed mode: the sufficiently large last-digit limitation will eventually fill
the supplied buffer and let the algorithm to return.

# Implementation overview

It is easy to get the floating point printing correct but slow (Russ Cox has
[demonstrated](https://research.swtch.com/ftoa) how it's easy), or incorrect but
fast (naïve division and modulo). But it is surprisingly hard to print
floating point numbers correctly *and* efficiently.

There are two classes of algorithms widely known to be correct.

- The "Dragon" family of algorithm is first described by Guy L. Steele Jr. and
  Jon L. White. They rely on the fixed-size big integer for their correctness.
  A slight improvement was found later, which is posthumously described by
  Robert G. Burger and R. Kent Dybvig. David Gay's `dtoa.c` routine is
  a popular implementation of this strategy.

- The "Grisu" family of algorithm is first described by Florian Loitsch.
  They use very cheap integer-only procedure to determine the close-to-correct
  representation which is at least guaranteed to be shortest. The variant,
  Grisu3, actively detects if the resulting representation is incorrect.

We implement both algorithms with necessary tweaks to suit our requirements.
In particular, published literatures are short of the actual implementation
difficulties like how to avoid arithmetic overflows. Each implementation,
available in `strategy::dragon` and `strategy::grisu` respectively,
extensively describes all necessary justifications and many proofs for them.
(It is still difficult to follow though. You have been warned.)

Both implementations expose two public functions:

- `format_shortest(decoded, buf)`, which always needs at least
  `MAX_SIG_DIGITS` digits of buffer. Implements the shortest mode.

- `format_exact(decoded, buf, limit)`, which accepts as small as
  one digit of buffer. Implements exact and fixed modes.

They try to fill the `u8` buffer with digits and returns the number of digits
written and the exponent `k`. They are total for all finite `f32` and `f64`
inputs (Grisu internally falls back to Dragon if necessary).

The rendered digits are formatted into the actual string form with
four functions:

- `to_shortest_str` prints the shortest representation, which can be padded by
  zeroes to make *at least* given number of fractional digits.

- `to_shortest_exp_str` prints the shortest representation, which can be
  padded by zeroes when its exponent is in the specified ranges,
  or can be printed in the exponential form such as `1.23e45`.

- `to_exact_exp_str` prints the exact representation with given number of
  digits in the exponential form.

- `to_exact_fixed_str` prints the fixed representation with *exactly*
  given number of fractional digits.

They all return a slice of preallocated `Part` array, which corresponds to
the individual part of strings: a fixed string, a part of rendered digits,
a number of zeroes or a small (`u16`) number. The caller is expected to
provide a large enough buffer and `Part` array, and to assemble the final
string from resulting `Part`s itself.

All algorithms and formatting functions are accompanied by extensive tests
in `coretests::num::flt2dec` module. It also shows how to use individual
functions.

/// A wrapper type to construct uninitialized instances of `T`.
///
/// # Initialization invariant
///
/// The compiler, in general, assumes that a variable is properly initialized
/// according to the requirements of the variable's type. For example, a variable of
/// reference type must be aligned and non-null. This is an invariant that must
/// *always* be upheld, even in unsafe code. As a consequence, zero-initializing a
/// variable of reference type causes instantaneous [undefined behavior][ub],
/// no matter whether that reference ever gets used to access memory:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #![allow(invalid_value)]
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let x: &i32 = unsafe { mem::zeroed() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// // The equivalent code with `MaybeUninit<&i32>`:
/// let x: &i32 = unsafe { MaybeUninit::zeroed().assume_init() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// ```
///
/// This is exploited by the compiler for various optimizations, such as eliding
/// run-time checks and optimizing `enum` layout.
///
/// Similarly, entirely uninitialized memory may have any content, while a `bool` must
/// always be `true` or `false`. Hence, creating an uninitialized `bool` is undefined behavior:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #![allow(invalid_value)]
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let b: bool = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// // The equivalent code with `MaybeUninit<bool>`:
/// let b: bool = unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// ```
///
/// Moreover, uninitialized memory is special in that it does not have a fixed value ("fixed"
/// meaning "it won't change without being written to"). Reading the same uninitialized byte
/// multiple times can give different results. This makes it undefined behavior to have
/// uninitialized data in a variable even if that variable has an integer type, which otherwise can
/// hold any *fixed* bit pattern:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #![allow(invalid_value)]
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let x: i32 = unsafe { mem::uninitialized() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// // The equivalent code with `MaybeUninit<i32>`:
/// let x: i32 = unsafe { MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init() }; // undefined behavior! ⚠️
/// ```
/// (Notice that the rules around uninitialized integers are not finalized yet, but
/// until they are, it is advisable to avoid them.)
///
/// On top of that, remember that most types have additional invariants beyond merely
/// being considered initialized at the type level. For example, a `1`-initialized [`Vec<T>`]
/// is considered initialized (under the current implementation; this does not constitute
/// a stable guarantee) because the only requirement the compiler knows about it
/// is that the data pointer must be non-null. Creating such a `Vec<T>` does not cause
/// *immediate* undefined behavior, but will cause undefined behavior with most
/// safe operations (including dropping it).
///
/// [`Vec<T>`]: ../../std/vec/struct.Vec.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// `MaybeUninit<T>` serves to enable unsafe code to deal with uninitialized data.
/// It is a signal to the compiler indicating that the data here might *not*
/// be initialized:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
///
/// // Create an explicitly uninitialized reference. The compiler knows that data inside
/// // a `MaybeUninit<T>` may be invalid, and hence this is not UB:
/// let mut x = MaybeUninit::<&i32>::uninit();
/// // Set it to a valid value.
/// x.write(&0);
/// // Extract the initialized data -- this is only allowed *after* properly
/// // initializing `x`!
/// let x = unsafe { x.assume_init() };
/// ```
///
/// The compiler then knows to not make any incorrect assumptions or optimizations on this code.
///
/// You can think of `MaybeUninit<T>` as being a bit like `Option<T>` but without
/// any of the run-time tracking and without any of the safety checks.
///
/// ## out-pointers
///
/// You can use `MaybeUninit<T>` to implement "out-pointers": instead of returning data
/// from a function, pass it a pointer to some (uninitialized) memory to put the
/// result into. This can be useful when it is important for the caller to control
/// how the memory the result is stored in gets allocated, and you want to avoid
/// unnecessary moves.
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
///
/// unsafe fn make_vec(out: *mut Vec<i32>) {
///     // `write` does not drop the old contents, which is important.
///     out.write(vec![1, 2, 3]);
/// }
///
/// let mut v = MaybeUninit::uninit();
/// unsafe { make_vec(v.as_mut_ptr()); }
/// // Now we know `v` is initialized! This also makes sure the vector gets
/// // properly dropped.
/// let v = unsafe { v.assume_init() };
/// assert_eq!(&v, &[1, 2, 3]);
/// ```
///
/// ## Initializing an array element-by-element
///
/// `MaybeUninit<T>` can be used to initialize a large array element-by-element:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::{self, MaybeUninit};
///
/// let data = {
///     // Create an uninitialized array of `MaybeUninit`. The `assume_init` is
///     // safe because the type we are claiming to have initialized here is a
///     // bunch of `MaybeUninit`s, which do not require initialization.
///     let mut data: [MaybeUninit<Vec<u32>>; 1000] = unsafe {
///         MaybeUninit::uninit().assume_init()
///     };
///
///     // Dropping a `MaybeUninit` does nothing. Thus using raw pointer
///     // assignment instead of `ptr::write` does not cause the old
///     // uninitialized value to be dropped. Also if there is a panic during
///     // this loop, we have a memory leak, but there is no memory safety
///     // issue.
///     for elem in &mut data[..] {
///         elem.write(vec![42]);
///     }
///
///     // Everything is initialized. Transmute the array to the
///     // initialized type.
///     unsafe { mem::transmute::<_, [Vec<u32>; 1000]>(data) }

/// You can use `MaybeUninit<T>`, and the [`std::ptr::addr_of_mut`] macro, to initialize structs field by field:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem::MaybeUninit;
/// use std::ptr::addr_of_mut;
///
/// #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
/// pub struct Foo {
///     name: String,
///     list: Vec<u8>,
/// }
///
/// let foo = {
///     let mut uninit: MaybeUninit<Foo> = MaybeUninit::uninit();
///     let ptr = uninit.as_mut_ptr();
///
///     // Initializing the `name` field
///     // Using `write` instead of assignment via `=` to not call `drop` on the
///     // old, uninitialized value.
///     unsafe { addr_of_mut!((*ptr).name).write("Bob".to_string()); }
///
///     // Initializing the `list` field
///     // If there is a panic here, then the `String` in the `name` field leaks.
///     unsafe { addr_of_mut!((*ptr).list).write(vec![0, 1, 2]); }
///
///     // All the fields are initialized, so we call `assume_init` to get an initialized Foo.
///     unsafe { uninit.assume_init() }
/// };
///
/// assert_eq!(
///     foo,
///     Foo {
///         name: "Bob".to_string(),
///         list: vec![0, 1, 2]
///     }
/// );
/// ```

/// # Layout
///
/// `MaybeUninit<T>` is guaranteed to have the same size, alignment, and ABI as `T`:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::mem::{MaybeUninit, size_of, align_of};
/// assert_eq!(size_of::<MaybeUninit<u64>>(), size_of::<u64>());
/// assert_eq!(align_of::<MaybeUninit<u64>>(), align_of::<u64>());
/// ```
///
/// However remember that a type *containing* a `MaybeUninit<T>` is not necessarily the same
/// layout; Rust does not in general guarantee that the fields of a `Foo<T>` have the same order as
/// a `Foo<U>` even if `T` and `U` have the same size and alignment. Furthermore because any bit
/// value is valid for a `MaybeUninit<T>` the compiler can't apply non-zero/niche-filling
/// optimizations, potentially resulting in a larger size:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::mem::{MaybeUninit, size_of};
/// assert_eq!(size_of::<Option<bool>>(), 1);
/// assert_eq!(size_of::<Option<MaybeUninit<bool>>>(), 2);
/// ```
///
/// If `T` is FFI-safe, then so is `MaybeUninit<T>`.
///
/// While `MaybeUninit` is `#[repr(transparent)]` (indicating it guarantees the same size,
/// alignment, and ABI as `T`), this does *not* change any of the previous caveats. `Option<T>` and
/// `Option<MaybeUninit<T>>` may still have different sizes, and types containing a field of type
/// `T` may be laid out (and sized) differently than if that field were `MaybeUninit<T>`.
/// `MaybeUninit` is a union type, and `#[repr(transparent)]` on unions is unstable (see [the
/// tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60405)). Over time, the exact
/// guarantees of `#[repr(transparent)]` on unions may evolve, and `MaybeUninit` may or may not
/// remain `#[repr(transparent)]`. That said, `MaybeUninit<T>` will *always* guarantee that it has
/// the same size, alignment, and ABI as `T`; it's just that the way `MaybeUninit` implements that
/// guarantee may evolve.

///
/// # Safety
///
/// `forget` is not marked as `unsafe`, because Rust's safety guarantees
/// do not include a guarantee that destructors will always run. For example,
/// a program can create a reference cycle using [`Rc`][rc], or call
/// [`process::exit`][exit] to exit without running destructors. Thus, allowing
/// `mem::forget` from safe code does not fundamentally change Rust's safety
/// guarantees.
///
/// That said, leaking resources such as memory or I/O objects is usually undesirable.
/// The need comes up in some specialized use cases for FFI or unsafe code, but even
/// then, [`ManuallyDrop`] is typically preferred.
///
/// Because forgetting a value is allowed, any `unsafe` code you write must
/// allow for this possibility. You cannot return a value and expect that the
/// caller will necessarily run the value's destructor.
///
/// [rc]: ../../std/rc/struct.Rc.html
/// [exit]: ../../std/process/fn.exit.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The canonical safe use of `mem::forget` is to circumvent a value's destructor
/// implemented by the `Drop` trait. For example, this will leak a `File`, i.e. reclaim
/// the space taken by the variable but never close the underlying system resource:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::fs::File;
///
/// let file = File::open("foo.txt").unwrap();
/// mem::forget(file);
/// ```
///
/// This is useful when the ownership of the underlying resource was previously
/// transferred to code outside of Rust, for example by transmitting the raw
/// file descriptor to C code.
///
/// # Relationship with `ManuallyDrop`
///
/// While `mem::forget` can also be used to transfer *memory* ownership, doing so is error-prone.
/// [`ManuallyDrop`] should be used instead. Consider, for example, this code:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
///
/// let mut v = vec![65, 122];
/// // Build a `String` using the contents of `v`
/// let s = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts(v.as_mut_ptr(), v.len(), v.capacity()) };
/// // leak `v` because its memory is now managed by `s`
/// mem::forget(v);  // ERROR - v is invalid and must not be passed to a function
/// assert_eq!(s, "Az");
/// // `s` is implicitly dropped and its memory deallocated.
/// ```
///
/// There are two issues with the above example:
///
/// * If more code were added between the construction of `String` and the invocation of
///   `mem::forget()`, a panic within it would cause a double free because the same memory
///   is handled by both `v` and `s`.
/// * After calling `v.as_mut_ptr()` and transmitting the ownership of the data to `s`,
///   the `v` value is invalid. Even when a value is just moved to `mem::forget` (which won't
///   inspect it), some types have strict requirements on their values that
///   make them invalid when dangling or no longer owned. Using invalid values in any
///   way, including passing them to or returning them from functions, constitutes
///   undefined behavior and may break the assumptions made by the compiler.
///
/// Switching to `ManuallyDrop` avoids both issues:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::ManuallyDrop;
///
/// let v = vec![65, 122];
/// // Before we disassemble `v` into its raw parts, make sure it
/// // does not get dropped!
/// let mut v = ManuallyDrop::new(v);
/// // Now disassemble `v`. These operations cannot panic, so there cannot be a leak.
/// let (ptr, len, cap) = (v.as_mut_ptr(), v.len(), v.capacity());
/// // Finally, build a `String`.
/// let s = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, cap) };
/// assert_eq!(s, "Az");
/// // `s` is implicitly dropped and its memory deallocated.
/// ```
///
/// `ManuallyDrop` robustly prevents double-free because we disable `v`'s destructor
/// before doing anything else. `mem::forget()` doesn't allow this because it consumes its
/// argument, forcing us to call it only after extracting anything we need from `v`. Even
/// if a panic were introduced between construction of `ManuallyDrop` and building the
/// string (which cannot happen in the code as shown), it would result in a leak and not a
/// double free. In other words, `ManuallyDrop` errs on the side of leaking instead of
/// erring on the side of (double-)dropping.
///
/// Also, `ManuallyDrop` prevents us from having to "touch" `v` after transferring the
/// ownership to `s` — the final step of interacting with `v` to dispose of it without
/// running its destructor is entirely avoided.

pub mod ptr {
//! Manually manage memory through raw pointers.
//!
//! *[See also the pointer primitive types](pointer).*
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Many functions in this module take raw pointers as arguments and read from
//! or write to them. For this to be safe, these pointers must be *valid*.
//! Whether a pointer is valid depends on the operation it is used for
//! (read or write), and the extent of the memory that is accessed (i.e.,
//! how many bytes are read/written). Most functions use `*mut T` and `*const T`
//! to access only a single value, in which case the documentation omits the size
//! and implicitly assumes it to be `size_of::<T>()` bytes.
//!
//! The precise rules for validity are not determined yet. The guarantees that are
//! provided at this point are very minimal:
//!
//! * A [null] pointer is *never* valid, not even for accesses of [size zero][zst].
//! * For a pointer to be valid, it is necessary, but not always sufficient, that the pointer
//!   be *dereferenceable*: the memory range of the given size starting at the pointer must all be
//!   within the bounds of a single allocated object. Note that in Rust,
//!   every (stack-allocated) variable is considered a separate allocated object.
//! * Even for operations of [size zero][zst], the pointer must not be pointing to deallocated
//!   memory, i.e., deallocation makes pointers invalid even for zero-sized operations. However,
//!   casting any non-zero integer *literal* to a pointer is valid for zero-sized accesses, even if
//!   some memory happens to exist at that address and gets deallocated. This corresponds to writing
//!   your own allocator: allocating zero-sized objects is not very hard. The canonical way to
//!   obtain a pointer that is valid for zero-sized accesses is [`NonNull::dangling`].
//FIXME: mention `ptr::invalid` above, once it is stable.
//! * All accesses performed by functions in this module are *non-atomic* in the sense
//!   of [atomic operations] used to synchronize between threads. This means it is
//!   undefined behavior to perform two concurrent accesses to the same location from different
//!   threads unless both accesses only read from memory. Notice that this explicitly
//!   includes [`read_volatile`] and [`write_volatile`]: Volatile accesses cannot
//!   be used for inter-thread synchronization.
//! * The result of casting a reference to a pointer is valid for as long as the
//!   underlying object is live and no reference (just raw pointers) is used to
//!   access the same memory.
//!
//! These axioms, along with careful use of [`offset`] for pointer arithmetic,
//! are enough to correctly implement many useful things in unsafe code. Stronger guarantees
//! will be provided eventually, as the [aliasing] rules are being determined. For more
//! information, see the [book] as well as the section in the reference devoted
//! to [undefined behavior][ub].
//!
//! ## Alignment
//!
//! Valid raw pointers as defined above are not necessarily properly aligned (where
//! "proper" alignment is defined by the pointee type, i.e., `*const T` must be
//! aligned to `mem::align_of::<T>()`). However, most functions require their
//! arguments to be properly aligned, and will explicitly state
//! this requirement in their documentation. Notable exceptions to this are
//! [`read_unaligned`] and [`write_unaligned`].
//!
//! When a function requires proper alignment, it does so even if the access
//! has size 0, i.e., even if memory is not actually touched. Consider using
//! [`NonNull::dangling`] in such cases.
//!
//! ## Allocated object
//!
//! For several operations, such as [`offset`] or field projections (`expr.field`), the notion of an
//! "allocated object" becomes relevant. An allocated object is a contiguous region of memory.
//! Common examples of allocated objects include stack-allocated variables (each variable is a
//! separate allocated object), heap allocations (each allocation created by the global allocator is
//! a separate allocated object), and `static` variables.
//!
//!
//! # Strict Provenance
//!
//! **The following text is non-normative, insufficiently formal, and is an extremely strict
//! interpretation of provenance. It's ok if your code doesn't strictly conform to it.**
//!
//! [Strict Provenance][] is an experimental set of APIs that help tools that try
//! to validate the memory-safety of your program's execution. Notably this includes [Miri][]
//! and [CHERI][], which can detect when you access out of bounds memory or otherwise violate
//! Rust's memory model.
//!
//! Provenance must exist in some form for any programming
//! language compiled for modern computer architectures, but specifying a model for provenance
//! in a way that is useful to both compilers and programmers is an ongoing challenge.
//! The [Strict Provenance][] experiment seeks to explore the question: *what if we just said you
//! couldn't do all the nasty operations that make provenance so messy?*
//!
//! What APIs would have to be removed? What APIs would have to be added? How much would code
//! have to change, and is it worse or better now? Would any patterns become truly inexpressible?
//! Could we carve out special exceptions for those patterns? Should we?
//!
//! A secondary goal of this project is to see if we can disambiguate the many functions of
//! pointer<->integer casts enough for the definition of `usize` to be loosened so that it
//! isn't *pointer*-sized but address-space/offset/allocation-sized (we'll probably continue
//! to conflate these notions). This would potentially make it possible to more efficiently
//! target platforms where pointers are larger than offsets, such as CHERI and maybe some
//! segmented architecures.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! **This section is *non-normative* and is part of the [Strict Provenance][] experiment.**
//!
//! Pointers are not *simply* an "integer" or "address". For instance, it's uncontroversial
//! to say that a Use After Free is clearly Undefined Behaviour, even if you "get lucky"
//! and the freed memory gets reallocated before your read/write (in fact this is the
//! worst-case scenario, UAFs would be much less concerning if this didn't happen!).
//! To rationalize this claim, pointers need to somehow be *more* than just their addresses:
//! they must have provenance.
//!
//! When an allocation is created, that allocation has a unique Original Pointer. For alloc
//! APIs this is literally the pointer the call returns, and for local variables and statics,
//! this is the name of the variable/static. This is mildly overloading the term "pointer"
//! for the sake of brevity/exposition.
//!
//! The Original Pointer for an allocation is guaranteed to have unique access to the entire
//! allocation and *only* that allocation. In this sense, an allocation can be thought of
//! as a "sandbox" that cannot be broken into or out of. *Provenance* is the permission
//! to access an allocation's sandbox and has both a *spatial* and *temporal* component:
//!
//! * Spatial: A range of bytes that the pointer is allowed to access.
//! * Temporal: The lifetime (of the allocation) that access to these bytes is tied to.
//!
//! Spatial provenance makes sure you don't go beyond your sandbox, while temporal provenance
//! makes sure that you can't "get lucky" after your permission to access some memory
//! has been revoked (either through deallocations or borrows expiring).
//!
//! Provenance is implicitly shared with all pointers transitively derived from
//! The Original Pointer through operations like [`offset`], borrowing, and pointer casts.
//! Some operations may *shrink* the derived provenance, limiting how much memory it can
//! access or how long it's valid for (i.e. borrowing a subfield and subslicing).
//!
//! Shrinking provenance cannot be undone: even if you "know" there is a larger allocation, you
//! can't derive a pointer with a larger provenance. Similarly, you cannot "recombine"
//! two contiguous provenances back into one (i.e. with a `fn merge(&[T], &[T]) -> &[T]`).
//!
//! A reference to a value always has provenance over exactly the memory that field occupies.
//! A reference to a slice always has provenance over exactly the range that slice describes.
//!
//! If an allocation is deallocated, all pointers with provenance to that allocation become
//! invalidated, and effectively lose their provenance.
//!
//! The strict provenance experiment is mostly only interested in exploring stricter *spatial*
//! provenance. In this sense it can be thought of as a subset of the more ambitious and
//! formal [Stacked Borrows][] research project, which is what tools like [Miri][] are based on.
//! In particular, Stacked Borrows is necessary to properly describe what borrows are allowed
//! to do and when they become invalidated. This necessarily involves much more complex
//! *temporal* reasoning than simply identifying allocations. Adjusting APIs and code
//! for the strict provenance experiment will also greatly help Stacked Borrows.
//!
//!
//! ## Pointer Vs Addresses
//!
//! **This section is *non-normative* and is part of the [Strict Provenance][] experiment.**
//!
//! One of the largest historical issues with trying to define provenance is that programmers
//! freely convert between pointers and integers. Once you allow for this, it generally becomes
//! impossible to accurately track and preserve provenance information, and you need to appeal
//! to very complex and unreliable heuristics. But of course, converting between pointers and
//! integers is very useful, so what can we do?
//!
//! Also did you know WASM is actually a "Harvard Architecture"? As in function pointers are
//! handled completely differently from data pointers? And we kind of just shipped Rust on WASM
//! without really addressing the fact that we let you freely convert between function pointers
//! and data pointers, because it mostly Just Works? Let's just put that on the "pointer casts
//! are dubious" pile.
//!
//! Strict Provenance attempts to square these circles by decoupling Rust's traditional conflation
//! of pointers and `usize` (and `isize`), and defining a pointer to semantically contain the
//! following information:
//!
//! * The **address-space** it is part of (e.g. "data" vs "code" in WASM).
//! * The **address** it points to, which can be represented by a `usize`.
//! * The **provenance** it has, defining the memory it has permission to access.
//!
//! Under Strict Provenance, a usize *cannot* accurately represent a pointer, and converting from
//! a pointer to a usize is generally an operation which *only* extracts the address. It is
//! therefore *impossible* to construct a valid pointer from a usize because there is no way
//! to restore the address-space and provenance. In other words, pointer-integer-pointer
//! roundtrips are not possible (in the sense that the resulting pointer is not dereferencable).
//!
//! The key insight to making this model *at all* viable is the [`with_addr`][] method:
//!
//! ```text
//!     /// Creates a new pointer with the given address.
//!     ///
//!     /// This performs the same operation as an `addr as ptr` cast, but copies
//!     /// the *address-space* and *provenance* of `self` to the new pointer.
//!     /// This allows us to dynamically preserve and propagate this important
//!     /// information in a way that is otherwise impossible with a unary cast.
//!     ///
//!     /// This is equivalent to using `wrapping_offset` to offset `self` to the
//!     /// given address, and therefore has all the same capabilities and restrictions.
//!     pub fn with_addr(self, addr: usize) -> Self;
//! ```
//!
//! So you're still able to drop down to the address representation and do whatever
//! clever bit tricks you want *as long as* you're able to keep around a pointer
//! into the allocation you care about that can "reconstitute" the other parts of the pointer.
//! Usually this is very easy, because you only are taking a pointer, messing with the address,
//! and then immediately converting back to a pointer. To make this use case more ergonomic,
//! we provide the [`map_addr`][] method.
//!
//! To help make it clear that code is "following" Strict Provenance semantics, we also provide an
//! [`addr`][] method which promises that the returned address is not part of a
//! pointer-usize-pointer roundtrip. In the future we may provide a lint for pointer<->integer
//! casts to help you audit if your code conforms to strict provenance.
//!
//!
//! ## Using Strict Provenance
//!
//! Most code needs no changes to conform to strict provenance, as the only really concerning
//! operation that *wasn't* obviously already Undefined Behaviour is casts from usize to a
//! pointer. For code which *does* cast a usize to a pointer, the scope of the change depends
//! on exactly what you're doing.
//!
//! In general you just need to make sure that if you want to convert a usize address to a
//! pointer and then use that pointer to read/write memory, you need to keep around a pointer
//! that has sufficient provenance to perform that read/write itself. In this way all of your
//! casts from an address to a pointer are essentially just applying offsets/indexing.
//!
//! This is generally trivial to do for simple cases like tagged pointers *as long as you
//! represent the tagged pointer as an actual pointer and not a usize*. For instance:
//!
//! ```
//! #![feature(strict_provenance)]
//!
//! unsafe {

//!
//! (Yes, if you've been using AtomicUsize for pointers in concurrent datastructures, you should
//! be using AtomicPtr instead. If that messes up the way you atomically manipulate pointers,
//! we would like to know why, and what needs to be done to fix it.)
//!
//! Something more complicated and just generally *evil* like an XOR-List requires more significant
//! changes like allocating all nodes in a pre-allocated Vec or Arena and using a pointer
//! to the whole allocation to reconstitute the XORed addresses.
//!
//! Situations where a valid pointer *must* be created from just an address, such as baremetal code
//! accessing a memory-mapped interface at a fixed address, are an open question on how to support.
//! These situations *will* still be allowed, but we might require some kind of "I know what I'm
//! doing" annotation to explain the situation to the compiler. It's also possible they need no
//! special attention at all, because they're generally accessing memory outside the scope of
//! "the abstract machine", or already using "I know what I'm doing" annotations like "volatile".
//!
//! Under [Strict Provenance] it is Undefined Behaviour to:
//!
//! * Access memory through a pointer that does not have provenance over that memory.
//!
//! * [`offset`] a pointer to or from an address it doesn't have provenance over.
//!   This means it's always UB to offset a pointer derived from something deallocated,
//!   even if the offset is 0. Note that a pointer "one past the end" of its provenance
//!   is not actually outside its provenance, it just has 0 bytes it can load/store.
//!
//! But it *is* still sound to:
//!
//! * Create an invalid pointer from just an address (see [`ptr::invalid`][]). This can
//!   be used for sentinel values like `null` *or* to represent a tagged pointer that will
//!   never be dereferencable. In general, it is always sound for an integer to pretend
//!   to be a pointer "for fun" as long as you don't use operations on it which require
//!   it to be valid (offset, read, write, etc).
//!
//! * Forge an allocation of size zero at any sufficiently aligned non-null address.
//!   i.e. the usual "ZSTs are fake, do what you want" rules apply *but* this only applies
//!   for actual forgery (integers cast to pointers). If you borrow some struct's field
//!   that *happens* to be zero-sized, the resulting pointer will have provenance tied to
//!   that allocation and it will still get invalidated if the allocation gets deallocated.
//!   In the future we may introduce an API to make such a forged allocation explicit.
//!
//! * [`wrapping_offset`][] a pointer outside its provenance. This includes invalid pointers
//!   which have "no" provenance. Unfortunately there may be practical limits on this for a
//!   particular platform, and it's an open question as to how to specify this (if at all).
//!   Notably, [CHERI][] relies on a compression scheme that can't handle a
//!   pointer getting offset "too far" out of bounds. If this happens, the address
//!   returned by `addr` will be the value you expect, but the provenance will get invalidated
//!   and using it to read/write will fault. The details of this are architecture-specific
//!   and based on alignment, but the buffer on either side of the pointer's range is pretty
//!   generous (think kilobytes, not bytes).
//!
//! * Compare arbitrary pointers by address. Addresses *are* just integers and so there is
//!   always a coherent answer, even if the pointers are invalid or from different
//!   address-spaces/provenances. Of course, comparing addresses from different address-spaces
//!   is generally going to be *meaningless*, but so is comparing Kilograms to Meters, and Rust
//!   doesn't prevent that either. Similarly, if you get "lucky" and notice that a pointer
//!   one-past-the-end is the "same" address as the start of an unrelated allocation, anything
//!   you do with that fact is *probably* going to be gibberish. The scope of that gibberish
//!   is kept under control by the fact that the two pointers *still* aren't allowed to access
//!   the other's allocation (bytes), because they still have different provenance.
//!
//! * Perform pointer tagging tricks. This falls out of [`wrapping_offset`] but is worth
//!   mentioning in more detail because of the limitations of [CHERI][]. Low-bit tagging
//!   is very robust, and often doesn't even go out of bounds because types ensure
//!   size >= align (and over-aligning actually gives CHERI more flexibility). Anything
//!   more complex than this rapidly enters "extremely platform-specific" territory as
//!   certain things may or may not be allowed based on specific supported operations.
//!   For instance, ARM explicitly supports high-bit tagging, and so CHERI on ARM inherits
//!   that and should support it.
//!
//! ## Pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips and 'exposed' provenance
//!
//! **This section is *non-normative* and is part of the [Strict Provenance] experiment.**
//!
//! As discussed above, pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips are not possible under [Strict Provenance].
//! However, there exists legacy Rust code that is full of such roundtrips, and legacy platform APIs
//! regularly assume that `usize` can capture all the information that makes up a pointer. There
//! also might be code that cannot be ported to Strict Provenance (which is something we would [like
//! to hear about][Strict Provenance]).
//!
//! For situations like this, there is a fallback plan, a way to 'opt out' of Strict Provenance.
//! However, note that this makes your code a lot harder to specify, and the code will not work
//! (well) with tools like [Miri] and [CHERI].
//!
//! This fallback plan is provided by the [`expose_addr`] and [`from_exposed_addr`] methods (which
//! are equivalent to `as` casts between pointers and integers). [`expose_addr`] is a lot like
//! [`addr`], but additionally adds the provenance of the pointer to a global list of 'exposed'
//! provenances. (This list is purely conceptual, it exists for the purpose of specifying Rust but
//! is not materialized in actual executions, except in tools like [Miri].) [`from_exposed_addr`]
//! can be used to construct a pointer with one of these previously 'exposed' provenances.
//! [`from_exposed_addr`] takes only `addr: usize` as arguments, so unlike in [`with_addr`] there is
//! no indication of what the correct provenance for the returned pointer is -- and that is exactly
//! what makes pointer-usize-pointer roundtrips so tricky to rigorously specify! There is no
//! algorithm that decides which provenance will be used. You can think of this as "guessing" the
//! right provenance, and the guess will be "maximally in your favor", in the sense that if there is
//! any way to avoid undefined behavior, then that is the guess that will be taken. However, if
//! there is *no* previously 'exposed' provenance that justifies the way the returned pointer will
//! be used, the program has undefined behavior.
//!
//! Using [`expose_addr`] or [`from_exposed_addr`] (or the equivalent `as` casts) means that code is
//! *not* following Strict Provenance rules. The goal of the Strict Provenance experiment is to
//! determine whether it is possible to use Rust without [`expose_addr`] and [`from_exposed_addr`].
//! If this is successful, it would be a major win for avoiding specification complexity and to
//! facilitate adoption of tools like [CHERI] and [Miri] that can be a big help in increasing the
//! confidence in (unsafe) Rust code.

/// For statically-sized types (that implement the `Sized` traits)

/// Pointers to [dynamically-sized types][dst] are said to be “wide” or “fat”,

///
/// * For structs whose last field is a DST, metadata is the metadata for the last field
/// * For the `str` type, metadata is the length in bytes as `usize`
/// * For slice types like `[T]`, metadata is the length in items as `usize`
/// * For trait objects like `dyn SomeTrait`, metadata is [`DynMetadata<Self>`][DynMetadata]

    /// the absolute position of that memory, so we cannot tell if the pointer is
    /// null or not.

    /// let s: &str = "Follow the rabbit";
    /// let ptr: *const u8 = s.as_ptr();

/// A trait for borrowing data.
///
/// In Rust, it is common to provide different representations of a type for
/// different use cases. For instance, storage location and management for a
/// value can be specifically chosen as appropriate for a particular use via
/// pointer types such as [`Box<T>`] or [`Rc<T>`]. Beyond these generic
/// wrappers that can be used with any type, some types provide optional
/// facets providing potentially costly functionality. An example for such a
/// type is [`String`] which adds the ability to extend a string to the basic
/// [`str`]. This requires keeping additional information unnecessary for a
/// simple, immutable string.
///
/// These types provide access to the underlying data through references
/// to the type of that data. They are said to be ‘borrowed as’ that type.
/// For instance, a [`Box<T>`] can be borrowed as `T` while a [`String`]
/// can be borrowed as `str`.
///
/// Types express that they can be borrowed as some type `T` by implementing
/// `Borrow<T>`, providing a reference to a `T` in the trait’s
/// [`borrow`] method. A type is free to borrow as several different types.
/// If it wishes to mutably borrow as the type – allowing the underlying data
/// to be modified, it can additionally implement [`BorrowMut<T>`].
///
/// Further, when providing implementations for additional traits, it needs
/// to be considered whether they should behave identical to those of the
/// underlying type as a consequence of acting as a representation of that
/// underlying type. Generic code typically uses `Borrow<T>` when it relies
/// on the identical behavior of these additional trait implementations.
/// These traits will likely appear as additional trait bounds.
///
/// In particular `Eq`, `Ord` and `Hash` must be equivalent for
/// borrowed and owned values: `x.borrow() == y.borrow()` should give the
/// same result as `x == y`.
///
/// If generic code merely needs to work for all types that can
/// provide a reference to related type `T`, it is often better to use
/// [`AsRef<T>`] as more types can safely implement it.
///
/// [`Box<T>`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html
/// [`Mutex<T>`]: ../../std/sync/struct.Mutex.html
/// [`Rc<T>`]: ../../std/rc/struct.Rc.html
/// [`String`]: ../../std/string/struct.String.html
/// [`borrow`]: Borrow::borrow
///
/// # Examples
///
/// As a data collection, [`HashMap<K, V>`] owns both keys and values. If
/// the key’s actual data is wrapped in a managing type of some kind, it
/// should, however, still be possible to search for a value using a
/// reference to the key’s data. For instance, if the key is a string, then
/// it is likely stored with the hash map as a [`String`], while it should
/// be possible to search using a [`&str`][`str`]. Thus, `insert` needs to
/// operate on a `String` while `get` needs to be able to use a `&str`.
///
/// Slightly simplified, the relevant parts of `HashMap<K, V>` look like
/// this:
///
/// ```
/// use std::borrow::Borrow;
/// use std::hash::Hash;
///
/// pub struct HashMap<K, V> {
///     # marker: ::std::marker::PhantomData<(K, V)>,
///     // fields omitted
/// }
///
/// impl<K, V> HashMap<K, V> {
///     pub fn insert(&self, key: K, value: V) -> Option<V>
///     where K: Hash + Eq
///     {
///         # unimplemented!()
///         // ...
///     }
///
///     pub fn get<Q>(&self, k: &Q) -> Option<&V>
///     where
///         K: Borrow<Q>,
///         Q: Hash + Eq + ?Sized
///     {
///         # unimplemented!()
///         // ...
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The entire hash map is generic over a key type `K`. Because these keys
/// are stored with the hash map, this type has to own the key’s data.
/// When inserting a key-value pair, the map is given such a `K` and needs
/// to find the correct hash bucket and check if the key is already present
/// based on that `K`. It therefore requires `K: Hash + Eq`.
///
/// When searching for a value in the map, however, having to provide a
/// reference to a `K` as the key to search for would require to always
/// create such an owned value. For string keys, this would mean a `String`
/// value needs to be created just for the search for cases where only a
/// `str` is available.
///
/// Instead, the `get` method is generic over the type of the underlying key
/// data, called `Q` in the method signature above. It states that `K`
/// borrows as a `Q` by requiring that `K: Borrow<Q>`. By additionally
/// requiring `Q: Hash + Eq`, it signals the requirement that `K` and `Q`
/// have implementations of the `Hash` and `Eq` traits that produce identical
/// results.
///
/// The implementation of `get` relies in particular on identical
/// implementations of `Hash` by determining the key’s hash bucket by calling
/// `Hash::hash` on the `Q` value even though it inserted the key based on

pub mod clone {
//! The `Clone` trait for types that cannot be 'implicitly copied'.
//!
//! In Rust, some simple types are "implicitly copyable" and when you
//! assign them or pass them as arguments, the receiver will get a copy,
//! leaving the original value in place. These types do not require
//! allocation to copy and do not have finalizers (i.e., they do not
//! contain owned boxes or implement [`Drop`]), so the compiler considers
//! them cheap and safe to copy. For other types copies must be made
//! explicitly, by convention implementing the [`Clone`] trait and calling
//! the [`clone`] method.
//!
//! [`clone`]: Clone::clone
//!
//! Basic usage example:
//!
//! ```
//! let s = String::new(); // String type implements Clone
//! let copy = s.clone(); // so we can clone it
//! ```
//!
//! To easily implement the Clone trait, you can also use
//! `#[derive(Clone)]`. Example:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Clone)] // we add the Clone trait to Morpheus struct
//! struct Morpheus {
//!    blue_pill: f32,
//!    red_pill: i64,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!    let f = Morpheus { blue_pill: 0.0, red_pill: 0 };
//!    let copy = f.clone(); // and now we can clone it!
//! }
//! ```

/// A common trait for the ability to explicitly duplicate an object.
///
/// Differs from [`Copy`] in that [`Copy`] is implicit and an inexpensive bit-wise copy, while
/// `Clone` is always explicit and may or may not be expensive. In order to enforce
/// these characteristics, Rust does not allow you to reimplement [`Copy`], but you
/// may reimplement `Clone` and run arbitrary code.
///
/// Since `Clone` is more general than [`Copy`], you can automatically make anything
/// [`Copy`] be `Clone` as well.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]` if all fields are `Clone`. The `derive`d
/// implementation of [`Clone`] calls [`clone`] on each field.
///
/// [`clone`]: Clone::clone
///
/// For a generic struct, `#[derive]` implements `Clone` conditionally by adding bound `Clone` on
/// generic parameters.
///
/// ```
/// // `derive` implements Clone for Reading<T> when T is Clone.
/// #[derive(Clone)]
/// struct Reading<T> {
///     frequency: T,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## How can I implement `Clone`?
///
/// Types that are [`Copy`] should have a trivial implementation of `Clone`. More formally:
/// if `T: Copy`, `x: T`, and `y: &T`, then `let x = y.clone();` is equivalent to `let x = *y;`.
/// Manual implementations should be careful to uphold this invariant; however, unsafe code
/// must not rely on it to ensure memory safety.
///
/// An example is a generic struct holding a function pointer. In this case, the
/// implementation of `Clone` cannot be `derive`d, but can be implemented as:
///
/// ```
/// struct Generate<T>(fn() -> T);
///
/// impl<T> Copy for Generate<T> {}
///
/// impl<T> Clone for Generate<T> {
///     fn clone(&self) -> Self {
///         *self
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Additional implementors
///
/// In addition to the [implementors listed below][impls],
/// the following types also implement `Clone`:
///
/// * Function item types (i.e., the distinct types defined for each function)
/// * Function pointer types (e.g., `fn() -> i32`)
/// * Closure types, if they capture no value from the environment
///   or if all such captured values implement `Clone` themselves.
///   Note that variables captured by shared reference always implement `Clone`
///   (even if the referent doesn't),
///   while variables captured by mutable reference never implement `Clone`.

//! This module contains various tools for ordering and comparing values. In

//!
//! * [`Eq`] and [`PartialEq`] are traits that allow you to define total and
//!   partial equality between values, respectively. Implementing them overloads
//!   the `==` and `!=` operators.
//! * [`Ord`] and [`PartialOrd`] are traits that allow you to define total and
//!   partial orderings between values, respectively. Implementing them overloads
//!   the `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` operators.
//! * [`Ordering`] is an enum returned by the main functions of [`Ord`] and
//!   [`PartialOrd`], and describes an ordering.
//! * [`Reverse`] is a struct that allows you to easily reverse an ordering.
//! * [`max`] and [`min`] are functions that build off of [`Ord`] and allow you
//!   to find the maximum or minimum of two values.
//!
//! For more details, see the respective documentation of each item in the list.
//!

/// Trait for equality comparisons which are [partial equivalence
/// relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_equivalence_relation).
///
/// `x.eq(y)` can also be written `x == y`, and `x.ne(y)` can be written `x != y`.
/// We use the easier-to-read infix notation in the remainder of this documentation.
///
/// This trait allows for partial equality, for types that do not have a full
/// equivalence relation. For example, in floating point numbers `NaN != NaN`,
/// so floating point types implement `PartialEq` but not [`trait@Eq`].
///
/// Implementations must ensure that `eq` and `ne` are consistent with each other:
///
/// - `a != b` if and only if `!(a == b)`
///   (ensured by the default implementation).
///
/// If [`PartialOrd`] or [`Ord`] are also implemented for `Self` and `Rhs`, their methods must also
/// be consistent with `PartialEq` (see the documentation of those traits for the exact
/// requirements). It's easy to accidentally make them disagree by deriving some of the traits and
/// manually implementing others.
///
/// The equality relation `==` must satisfy the following conditions
/// (for all `a`, `b`, `c` of type `A`, `B`, `C`):
///
/// - **Symmetric**: if `A: PartialEq<B>` and `B: PartialEq<A>`, then **`a == b`

/// - **Transitive**: if `A: PartialEq<B>` and `B: PartialEq<C>` and `A:

///
/// Note that the `B: PartialEq<A>` (symmetric) and `A: PartialEq<C>`
/// (transitive) impls are not forced to exist, but these requirements apply
/// whenever they do exist.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`. When `derive`d on structs, two
/// instances are equal if all fields are equal, and not equal if any fields
/// are not equal. When `derive`d on enums, two instances are equal if they
/// are the same variant and all fields are equal.
///
/// ## How can I implement `PartialEq`?
///
/// An example implementation for a domain in which two books are considered
/// the same book if their ISBN matches, even if the formats differ:
///
/// ```
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,

///
/// struct Book {

///         self.isbn == other.isbn
///     }
/// }
///
/// let b1 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
/// let b2 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Ebook };
/// let b3 = Book { isbn: 10, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
/// assert!(b1 == b2);
/// assert!(b1 != b3);
/// ```
///
/// ## How can I compare two different types?
///
/// The type you can compare with is controlled by `PartialEq`'s type parameter.
/// For example, let's tweak our previous code a bit:
///
/// ```
/// // The derive implements <BookFormat> == <BookFormat> comparisons
/// #[derive(PartialEq)]
/// enum BookFormat {
///     Paperback,
///     Hardback,
///     Ebook,
/// }
///
/// struct Book {
///     isbn: i32,
///     format: BookFormat,
/// }
///
/// // Implement <Book> == <BookFormat> comparisons
/// impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &BookFormat) -> bool {
///         self.format == *other
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Implement <BookFormat> == <Book> comparisons
/// impl PartialEq<Book> for BookFormat {
///     fn eq(&self, other: &Book) -> bool {
///         *self == other.format
///     }
/// }
///
/// let b1 = Book { isbn: 3, format: BookFormat::Paperback };
///
/// assert!(b1 == BookFormat::Paperback);
/// assert!(BookFormat::Ebook != b1);
/// ```
///
/// By changing `impl PartialEq for Book` to `impl PartialEq<BookFormat> for Book`,
/// we allow `BookFormat`s to be compared with `Book`s.
///
/// A comparison like the one above, which ignores some fields of the struct,
/// can be dangerous. It can easily lead to an unintended violation of the
/// requirements for a partial equivalence relation. For example, if we kept
/// the above implementation of `PartialEq<Book>` for `BookFormat` and added an
/// implementation of `PartialEq<Book>` for `Book` (either via a `#[derive]` or
/// via the manual implementation from the first example) then the result would

/// Trait for types that form a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order).
///
/// Implementations must be consistent with the [`PartialOrd`] implementation, and ensure
/// `max`, `min`, and `clamp` are consistent with `cmp`:
///
/// - `partial_cmp(a, b) == Some(cmp(a, b))`.
/// - `max(a, b) == max_by(a, b, cmp)` (ensured by the default implementation).
/// - `min(a, b) == min_by(a, b, cmp)` (ensured by the default implementation).
/// - For `a.clamp(min, max)`, see the [method docs](#method.clamp)
///   (ensured by the default implementation).
///
/// It's easy to accidentally make `cmp` and `partial_cmp` disagree by
/// deriving some of the traits and manually implementing others.
///
/// ## Corollaries
///
/// From the above and the requirements of `PartialOrd`, it follows that `<` defines a strict total order.
/// This means that for all `a`, `b` and `c`:
///
/// - exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b` or `a > b` is true; and
/// - `<` is transitive: `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
///
/// ## Derivable
///
/// This trait can be used with `#[derive]`.
///
/// When `derive`d on structs, it will produce a
/// [lexicographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) ordering
/// based on the top-to-bottom declaration order of the struct's members.
///
/// When `derive`d on enums, variants are ordered by their discriminants.
/// By default, the discriminant is smallest for variants at the top, and
/// largest for variants at the bottom. Here's an example:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
/// enum E {
///     Top,
///     Bottom,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Top < E::Bottom);
/// ```
///
/// However, manually setting the discriminants can override this default
/// behavior:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
/// enum E {
///     Top = 2,
///     Bottom = 1,
/// }
///
/// assert!(E::Bottom < E::Top);
/// ```
///
/// ## Lexicographical comparison
///
/// Lexicographical comparison is an operation with the following properties:
///  - Two sequences are compared element by element.
///  - The first mismatching element defines which sequence is lexicographically less or greater than the other.
///  - If one sequence is a prefix of another, the shorter sequence is lexicographically less than the other.
///  - If two sequence have equivalent elements and are of the same length, then the sequences are lexicographically equal.
///  - An empty sequence is lexicographically less than any non-empty sequence.
///  - Two empty sequences are lexicographically equal.
///
/// ## How can I implement `Ord`?
///
/// `Ord` requires that the type also be [`PartialOrd`] and [`Eq`] (which requires [`PartialEq`]).
///
/// Then you must define an implementation for [`cmp`]. You may find it useful to use
/// [`cmp`] on your type's fields.
///
/// Here's an example where you want to sort people by height only, disregarding `id`
/// and `name`:
///
/// ```
/// use std::cmp::Ordering;
///
/// #[derive(Eq)]
/// struct Person {
///     id: u32,
///     name: String,
///     height: u32,
/// }
///
/// impl Ord for Person {
///     fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
///         self.height.cmp(&other.height)
///     }

///     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
///         Some(self.cmp(other))
///     }

pub mod convert {
//! Traits for conversions between types.
//!
//! The traits in this module provide a way to convert from one type to another type.
//! Each trait serves a different purpose:
//!
//! - Implement the [`AsRef`] trait for cheap reference-to-reference conversions
//! - Implement the [`AsMut`] trait for cheap mutable-to-mutable conversions
//! - Implement the [`From`] trait for consuming value-to-value conversions
//! - Implement the [`Into`] trait for consuming value-to-value conversions to types
//!   outside the current crate
//! - The [`TryFrom`] and [`TryInto`] traits behave like [`From`] and [`Into`],
//!   but should be implemented when the conversion can fail.
//!
//! The traits in this module are often used as trait bounds for generic functions such that to
//! arguments of multiple types are supported. See the documentation of each trait for examples.
//!
//! As a library author, you should always prefer implementing [`From<T>`][`From`] or
//! [`TryFrom<T>`][`TryFrom`] rather than [`Into<U>`][`Into`] or [`TryInto<U>`][`TryInto`],
//! as [`From`] and [`TryFrom`] provide greater flexibility and offer
//! equivalent [`Into`] or [`TryInto`] implementations for free, thanks to a
//! blanket implementation in the standard library. When targeting a version prior to Rust 1.41, it
//! may be necessary to implement [`Into`] or [`TryInto`] directly when converting to a type
//! outside the current crate.
//!
//! # Generic Implementations
//!
//! - [`AsRef`] and [`AsMut`] auto-dereference if the inner type is a reference
//! - [`From`]`<U> for T` implies [`Into`]`<T> for U`
//! - [`TryFrom`]`<U> for T` implies [`TryInto`]`<T> for U`
//! - [`From`] and [`Into`] are reflexive, which means that all types can
//!   `into` themselves and `from` themselves
//!
//! See each trait for usage examples.

// THE NO-ERROR ERROR TYPE
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/// The error type for errors that can never happen.
///
/// Since this enum has no variant, a value of this type can never actually exist.
/// This can be useful for generic APIs that use [`Result`] and parameterize the error type,
/// to indicate that the result is always [`Ok`].
///
/// For example, the [`TryFrom`] trait (conversion that returns a [`Result`])
/// has a blanket implementation for all types where a reverse [`Into`] implementation exists.
///
/// ```ignore (illustrates std code, duplicating the impl in a doctest would be an error)
/// impl<T, U> TryFrom<U> for T where U: Into<T> {
///     type Error = Infallible;
///
///     fn try_from(value: U) -> Result<Self, Infallible> {
///         Ok(U::into(value))  // Never returns `Err`
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Future compatibility
///
/// This enum has the same role as [the `!` “never” type][never],
/// which is unstable in this version of Rust.
/// When `!` is stabilized, we plan to make `Infallible` a type alias to it:
///
/// ```ignore (illustrates future std change)
/// pub type Infallible = !;
/// ```
///
/// … and eventually deprecate `Infallible`.
///
/// However there is one case where `!` syntax can be used
/// before `!` is stabilized as a full-fledged type: in the position of a function’s return type.
/// Specifically, it is possible to have implementations for two different function pointer types:
///
/// ```
/// trait MyTrait {}
/// impl MyTrait for fn() -> ! {}
/// impl MyTrait for fn() -> std::convert::Infallible {}
/// ```
///
/// With `Infallible` being an enum, this code is valid.
/// However when `Infallible` becomes an alias for the never type,
/// the two `impl`s will start to overlap
/// and therefore will be disallowed by the language’s trait coherence rules.

///
/// ```
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]

///
/// We want to require that types of consts used in pattern matches
/// have the attribute `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]`.
///
/// In a more ideal world, we could check that requirement by just checking that
/// the given type implements both the `StructuralPartialEq` trait *and*
/// the `Eq` trait. However, you can have ADTs that *do* `derive(PartialEq, Eq)`,
/// and be a case that we want the compiler to accept, and yet the constant's
/// type fails to implement `Eq`.
///
/// Namely, a case like this:
///
/// ```rust
/// #[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
/// struct Wrap<X>(X);
///
/// fn higher_order(_: &()) { }
///
/// const CFN: Wrap<fn(&())> = Wrap(higher_order);

/// `PartialEq`, nor `Eq`, because `for<'a> fn(&'a _)` does not implement those
/// traits.)
///
/// Therefore, we cannot rely on naive check for `StructuralPartialEq` and
/// mere `Eq`.
///
/// As a hack to work around this, we use two separate traits injected by each
/// of the two derives (`#[derive(PartialEq)]` and `#[derive(Eq)]`) and check
/// that both of them are present as part of structural-match checking.

/// let y = x;
///
/// // `x` has moved into `y`, and so cannot be used

///
/// However, if a type implements `Copy`, it instead has 'copy semantics':

///

///
/// let y = x;
///
/// // `y` is a copy of `x`

///
/// It's important to note that in these two examples, the only difference is whether you
/// are allowed to access `x` after the assignment. Under the hood, both a copy and a move
/// can result in bits being copied in memory, although this is sometimes optimized away.
///
/// ## How can I implement `Copy`?
///
/// There are two ways to implement `Copy` on your type. The simplest is to use `derive`:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct MyStruct;
/// ```
///
/// You can also implement `Copy` and `Clone` manually:
///
/// ```
/// struct MyStruct;
///
/// impl Copy for MyStruct { }
///
/// impl Clone for MyStruct {
///     fn clone(&self) -> MyStruct {
///         *self
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// There is a small difference between the two: the `derive` strategy will also place a `Copy`
/// bound on type parameters, which isn't always desired.
///
/// ## What's the difference between `Copy` and `Clone`?
///
/// Copies happen implicitly, for example as part of an assignment `y = x`. The behavior of
/// `Copy` is not overloadable; it is always a simple bit-wise copy.
///
/// Cloning is an explicit action, `x.clone()`. The implementation of [`Clone`] can
/// provide any type-specific behavior necessary to duplicate values safely. For example,
/// the implementation of [`Clone`] for [`String`] needs to copy the pointed-to string
/// buffer in the heap. A simple bitwise copy of [`String`] values would merely copy the
/// pointer, leading to a double free down the line. For this reason, [`String`] is [`Clone`]
/// but not `Copy`.
///
/// [`Clone`] is a supertrait of `Copy`, so everything which is `Copy` must also implement
/// [`Clone`]. If a type is `Copy` then its [`Clone`] implementation only needs to return `*self`
/// (see the example above).
///
/// ## When can my type be `Copy`?
///
/// A type can implement `Copy` if all of its components implement `Copy`. For example, this
/// struct can be `Copy`:
///
/// ```
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct Point {
///    x: i32,
///    y: i32,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A struct can be `Copy`, and [`i32`] is `Copy`, therefore `Point` is eligible to be `Copy`.
/// By contrast, consider
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # struct Point;
/// struct PointList {
///     points: Vec<Point>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The struct `PointList` cannot implement `Copy`, because [`Vec<T>`] is not `Copy`. If we
/// attempt to derive a `Copy` implementation, we'll get an error:
///
/// ```text
/// the trait `Copy` may not be implemented for this type; field `points` does not implement `Copy`
/// ```
///
/// Shared references (`&T`) are also `Copy`, so a type can be `Copy`, even when it holds
/// shared references of types `T` that are *not* `Copy`. Consider the following struct,
/// which can implement `Copy`, because it only holds a *shared reference* to our non-`Copy`
/// type `PointList` from above:
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # struct PointList;
/// #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
/// struct PointListWrapper<'a> {
///     point_list_ref: &'a PointList,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## When *can't* my type be `Copy`?
///
/// Some types can't be copied safely. For example, copying `&mut T` would create an aliased
/// mutable reference. Copying [`String`] would duplicate responsibility for managing the
/// [`String`]'s buffer, leading to a double free.
///
/// Generalizing the latter case, any type implementing [`Drop`] can't be `Copy`, because it's
/// managing some resource besides its own [`size_of::<T>`] bytes.

/// * Function item types (i.e., the distinct types defined for each function)
/// * Function pointer types (e.g., `fn() -> i32`)
/// * Closure types, if they capture no value from the environment
///   or if all such captured values implement `Copy` themselves.
///   Note that variables captured by shared reference always implement `Copy`
///   (even if the referent doesn't),
///   while variables captured by mutable reference never implement `Copy`.

/// Types for which it is safe to share references between threads.
///
/// This trait is automatically implemented when the compiler determines

///
/// The precise definition is: a type `T` is [`Sync`] if and only if `&T` is
/// [`Send`]. In other words, if there is no possibility of
/// [undefined behavior][ub] (including data races) when passing
/// `&T` references between threads.
///
/// As one would expect, primitive types like [`u8`] and [`f64`]
/// are all [`Sync`], and so are simple aggregate types containing them,
/// like tuples, structs and enums. More examples of basic [`Sync`]
/// types include "immutable" types like `&T`, and those with simple
/// inherited mutability, such as [`Box<T>`][box], [`Vec<T>`][vec] and
/// most other collection types. (Generic parameters need to be [`Sync`]
/// for their container to be [`Sync`].)
///
/// A somewhat surprising consequence of the definition is that `&mut T`
/// is `Sync` (if `T` is `Sync`) even though it seems like that might
/// provide unsynchronized mutation. The trick is that a mutable
/// reference behind a shared reference (that is, `& &mut T`)
/// becomes read-only, as if it were a `& &T`. Hence there is no risk
/// of a data race.
///
/// Types that are not `Sync` are those that have "interior
/// mutability" in a non-thread-safe form, such as [`Cell`][cell]
/// and [`RefCell`][refcell]. These types allow for mutation of
/// their contents even through an immutable, shared reference. For
/// example the `set` method on [`Cell<T>`][cell] takes `&self`, so it requires
/// only a shared reference [`&Cell<T>`][cell]. The method performs no
/// synchronization, thus [`Cell`][cell] cannot be `Sync`.
///
/// Another example of a non-`Sync` type is the reference-counting
/// pointer [`Rc`][rc]. Given any reference [`&Rc<T>`][rc], you can clone
/// a new [`Rc<T>`][rc], modifying the reference counts in a non-atomic way.
///
/// For cases when one does need thread-safe interior mutability,
/// Rust provides [atomic data types], as well as explicit locking via
/// [`sync::Mutex`][mutex] and [`sync::RwLock`][rwlock]. These types
/// ensure that any mutation cannot cause data races, hence the types
/// are `Sync`. Likewise, [`sync::Arc`][arc] provides a thread-safe
/// analogue of [`Rc`][rc].
///
/// Any types with interior mutability must also use the
/// [`cell::UnsafeCell`][unsafecell] wrapper around the value(s) which
/// can be mutated through a shared reference. Failing to doing this is
/// [undefined behavior][ub]. For example, [`transmute`][transmute]-ing
/// from `&T` to `&mut T` is invalid.

///
/// For a more in-depth explanation of how to use `PhantomData<T>`, please see
/// [the Nomicon](../../nomicon/phantom-data.html).
///
/// # A ghastly note 👻👻👻
///
/// Though they both have scary names, `PhantomData` and 'phantom types' are
/// related, but not identical. A phantom type parameter is simply a type
/// parameter which is never used. In Rust, this often causes the compiler to
/// complain, and the solution is to add a "dummy" use by way of `PhantomData`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Unused lifetime parameters
///
/// Perhaps the most common use case for `PhantomData` is a struct that has an
/// unused lifetime parameter, typically as part of some unsafe code. For
/// example, here is a struct `Slice` that has two pointers of type `*const T`,
/// presumably pointing into an array somewhere:
///
/// ```compile_fail,E0392
/// struct Slice<'a, T> {
///     start: *const T,
///     end: *const T,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The intention is that the underlying data is only valid for the
/// lifetime `'a`, so `Slice` should not outlive `'a`. However, this
/// intent is not expressed in the code, since there are no uses of
/// the lifetime `'a` and hence it is not clear what data it applies
/// to. We can correct this by telling the compiler to act *as if* the
/// `Slice` struct contained a reference `&'a T`:
///
/// ```
/// use std::marker::PhantomData;
///
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]
/// struct Slice<'a, T: 'a> {
///     start: *const T,
///     end: *const T,
///     phantom: PhantomData<&'a T>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This also in turn requires the annotation `T: 'a`, indicating
/// that any references in `T` are valid over the lifetime `'a`.
///
/// When initializing a `Slice` you simply provide the value
/// `PhantomData` for the field `phantom`:
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # use std::marker::PhantomData;
/// # struct Slice<'a, T: 'a> {
/// #     start: *const T,
/// #     end: *const T,
/// #     phantom: PhantomData<&'a T>,
/// # }
/// fn borrow_vec<T>(vec: &Vec<T>) -> Slice<'_, T> {
///     let ptr = vec.as_ptr();
///     Slice {
///         start: ptr,
///         end: unsafe { ptr.add(vec.len()) },
///         phantom: PhantomData,
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Unused type parameters
///
/// It sometimes happens that you have unused type parameters which
/// indicate what type of data a struct is "tied" to, even though that
/// data is not actually found in the struct itself. Here is an
/// example where this arises with [FFI]. The foreign interface uses
/// handles of type `*mut ()` to refer to Rust values of different
/// types. We track the Rust type using a phantom type parameter on
/// the struct `ExternalResource` which wraps a handle.
///
/// [FFI]: ../../book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#using-extern-functions-to-call-external-code
///
/// ```
/// # #![allow(dead_code)]
/// # trait ResType { }
/// # struct ParamType;
/// # mod foreign_lib {
/// #     pub fn new(_: usize) -> *mut () { 42 as *mut () }
/// #     pub fn do_stuff(_: *mut (), _: usize) {}
/// # }
/// # fn convert_params(_: ParamType) -> usize { 42 }
/// use std::marker::PhantomData;
/// use std::mem;
///
/// struct ExternalResource<R> {
///    resource_handle: *mut (),
///    resource_type: PhantomData<R>,
/// }
///
/// impl<R: ResType> ExternalResource<R> {
///     fn new() -> Self {
///         let size_of_res = mem::size_of::<R>();
///         Self {
///             resource_handle: foreign_lib::new(size_of_res),
///             resource_type: PhantomData,
///         }
///     }
///
///     fn do_stuff(&self, param: ParamType) {
///         let foreign_params = convert_params(param);
///         foreign_lib::do_stuff(self.resource_handle, foreign_params);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Ownership and the drop check
///
/// Adding a field of type `PhantomData<T>` indicates that your
/// type owns data of type `T`. This in turn implies that when your
/// type is dropped, it may drop one or more instances of the type
/// `T`. This has bearing on the Rust compiler's [drop check]
/// analysis.
///
/// If your struct does not in fact *own* the data of type `T`, it is
/// better to use a reference type, like `PhantomData<&'a T>`
/// (ideally) or `PhantomData<*const T>` (if no lifetime applies), so
/// as not to indicate ownership.

//! Overloadable operators.
//!
//! Implementing these traits allows you to overload certain operators.
//!
//! Some of these traits are imported by the prelude, so they are available in
//! every Rust program. Only operators backed by traits can be overloaded. For
//! example, the addition operator (`+`) can be overloaded through the [`Add`]
//! trait, but since the assignment operator (`=`) has no backing trait, there
//! is no way of overloading its semantics. Additionally, this module does not
//! provide any mechanism to create new operators. If traitless overloading or
//! custom operators are required, you should look toward macros or compiler
//! plugins to extend Rust's syntax.
//!
//! Implementations of operator traits should be unsurprising in their
//! respective contexts, keeping in mind their usual meanings and
//! [operator precedence]. For example, when implementing [`Mul`], the operation
//! should have some resemblance to multiplication (and share expected
//! properties like associativity).
//!
//! Note that the `&&` and `||` operators short-circuit, i.e., they only
//! evaluate their second operand if it contributes to the result. Since this
//! behavior is not enforceable by traits, `&&` and `||` are not supported as
//! overloadable operators.
//!
//! Many of the operators take their operands by value. In non-generic
//! contexts involving built-in types, this is usually not a problem.
//! However, using these operators in generic code, requires some
//! attention if values have to be reused as opposed to letting the operators
//! consume them. One option is to occasionally use [`clone`].
//! Another option is to rely on the types involved providing additional
//! operator implementations for references. For example, for a user-defined
//! type `T` which is supposed to support addition, it is probably a good
//! idea to have both `T` and `&T` implement the traits [`Add<T>`][`Add`] and
//! [`Add<&T>`][`Add`] so that generic code can be written without unnecessary
//! cloning.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! This example creates a `Point` struct that implements [`Add`] and [`Sub`],
//! and then demonstrates adding and subtracting two `Point`s.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::ops::{Add, Sub};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq)]
//! struct Point {
//!     x: i32,
//!     y: i32,
//! }
//!
//! impl Add for Point {
//!     type Output = Self;
//!
//!     fn add(self, other: Self) -> Self {
//!         Self {x: self.x + other.x, y: self.y + other.y}
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl Sub for Point {
//!     type Output = Self;
//!
//!     fn sub(self, other: Self) -> Self {
//!         Self {x: self.x - other.x, y: self.y - other.y}
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! assert_eq!(Point {x: 3, y: 3}, Point {x: 1, y: 0} + Point {x: 2, y: 3});
//! assert_eq!(Point {x: -1, y: -3}, Point {x: 1, y: 0} - Point {x: 2, y: 3});
//! ```
//!
//! See the documentation for each trait for an example implementation.
//!
//! The [`Fn`], [`FnMut`], and [`FnOnce`] traits are implemented by types that can be
//! invoked like functions. Note that [`Fn`] takes `&self`, [`FnMut`] takes `&mut
//! self` and [`FnOnce`] takes `self`. These correspond to the three kinds of
//! methods that can be invoked on an instance: call-by-reference,
//! call-by-mutable-reference, and call-by-value. The most common use of these
//! traits is to act as bounds to higher-level functions that take functions or
//! closures as arguments.
//!
//! Taking a [`Fn`] as a parameter:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn call_with_one<F>(func: F) -> usize
//!     where F: Fn(usize) -> usize
//! {
//!     func(1)
//! }
//!
//! let double = |x| x * 2;
//! assert_eq!(call_with_one(double), 2);
//! ```
//!
//! Taking a [`FnMut`] as a parameter:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn do_twice<F>(mut func: F)
//!     where F: FnMut()
//! {
//!     func();
//!     func();
//! }
//!
//! let mut x: usize = 1;
//! {
//!     let add_two_to_x = || x += 2;
//!     do_twice(add_two_to_x);
//! }
//!
//! assert_eq!(x, 5);
//! ```
//!
//! Taking a [`FnOnce`] as a parameter:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn consume_with_relish<F>(func: F)
//!     where F: FnOnce() -> String
//! {
//!     // `func` consumes its captured variables, so it cannot be run more
//!     // than once
//!     println!("Consumed: {}", func());
//!
//!     println!("Delicious!");

/// When a value is no longer needed, Rust will run a "destructor" on that value.
/// The most common way that a value is no longer needed is when it goes out of
/// scope. Destructors may still run in other circumstances, but we're going to
/// focus on scope for the examples here. To learn about some of those other cases,
/// please see [the reference] section on destructors.
///
/// [the reference]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/destructors.html
///
/// This destructor consists of two components:
/// - A call to `Drop::drop` for that value, if this special `Drop` trait is implemented for its type.
/// - The automatically generated "drop glue" which recursively calls the destructors
///     of all the fields of this value.
///
/// As Rust automatically calls the destructors of all contained fields,
/// you don't have to implement `Drop` in most cases. But there are some cases where
/// it is useful, for example for types which directly manage a resource.
/// That resource may be memory, it may be a file descriptor, it may be a network socket.
/// Once a value of that type is no longer going to be used, it should "clean up" its
/// resource by freeing the memory or closing the file or socket. This is
/// the job of a destructor, and therefore the job of `Drop::drop`.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// To see destructors in action, let's take a look at the following program:
///
/// ```rust
/// struct HasDrop;
///
/// impl Drop for HasDrop {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         println!("Dropping HasDrop!");

/// ```
///
/// ## You cannot call `Drop::drop` yourself
///
/// Because `Drop::drop` is used to clean up a value, it may be dangerous to use this value after
/// the method has been called. As `Drop::drop` does not take ownership of its input,
/// Rust prevents misuse by not allowing you to call `Drop::drop` directly.
///
/// In other words, if you tried to explicitly call `Drop::drop` in the above example, you'd get a compiler error.
///
/// If you'd like to explicitly call the destructor of a value, [`mem::drop`] can be used instead.
///
/// [`mem::drop`]: drop
///
/// ## Drop order
///
/// Which of our two `HasDrop` drops first, though? For structs, it's the same
/// order that they're declared: first `one`, then `two`. If you'd like to try
/// this yourself, you can modify `HasDrop` above to contain some data, like an
/// integer, and then use it in the `println!` inside of `Drop`. This behavior is
/// guaranteed by the language.
///
/// Unlike for structs, local variables are dropped in reverse order:
///
/// ```rust
/// struct Foo;
///
/// impl Drop for Foo {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         println!("Dropping Foo!")
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct Bar;
///
/// impl Drop for Bar {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         println!("Dropping Bar!")
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let _foo = Foo;
///     let _bar = Bar;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This will print
///
/// ```text
/// Dropping Bar!
/// Dropping Foo!
/// ```
///
/// Please see [the reference] for the full rules.
///
/// [the reference]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/destructors.html
///
/// ## `Copy` and `Drop` are exclusive
///
/// You cannot implement both [`Copy`] and `Drop` on the same type. Types that
/// are `Copy` get implicitly duplicated by the compiler, making it very
/// hard to predict when, and how often destructors will be executed. As such,
/// these types cannot have destructors.

///
/// `Try` types are typically those containing two or more categories of values,

///
/// This is most often seen for error handling with [`Result`] and [`Option`].
/// The quintessential implementation of this trait is on [`ControlFlow`].
///
/// # Using `Try` in Generic Code
///
/// `Iterator::try_fold` was stabilized to call back in Rust 1.27, but
/// this trait is much newer.  To illustrate the various associated types and
/// methods, let's implement our own version.
///
/// As a reminder, an infallible version of a fold looks something like this:
/// ```
/// fn simple_fold<A, T>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> A,
/// ) -> A {
///     for x in iter {
///         accum = f(accum, x);
///     }
///     accum
/// }
/// ```
///
/// So instead of `f` returning just an `A`, we'll need it to return some other
/// type that produces an `A` in the "don't short circuit" path.  Conveniently,
/// that's also the type we need to return from the function.
///
/// Let's add a new generic parameter `R` for that type, and bound it to the
/// output type that we want:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(try_trait_v2)]
/// # use std::ops::Try;
/// fn simple_try_fold_1<A, T, R: Try<Output = A>>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> R,
/// ) -> R {
///     todo!()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If we get through the entire iterator, we need to wrap up the accumulator
/// into the return type using [`Try::from_output`]:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(try_trait_v2)]
/// # use std::ops::{ControlFlow, Try};
/// fn simple_try_fold_2<A, T, R: Try<Output = A>>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> R,
/// ) -> R {
///     for x in iter {
///         let cf = f(accum, x).branch();
///         match cf {
///             ControlFlow::Continue(a) => accum = a,
///             ControlFlow::Break(_) => todo!(),
///         }
///     }
///     R::from_output(accum)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// We'll also need [`FromResidual::from_residual`] to turn the residual back
/// into the original type.  But because it's a supertrait of `Try`, we don't
/// need to mention it in the bounds.  All types which implement `Try` can be
/// recreated from their corresponding residual, so we'll just call it:
/// ```
/// # #![feature(try_trait_v2)]
/// # use std::ops::{ControlFlow, Try};
/// pub fn simple_try_fold_3<A, T, R: Try<Output = A>>(
///     iter: impl Iterator<Item = T>,
///     mut accum: A,
///     mut f: impl FnMut(A, T) -> R,
/// ) -> R {
///     for x in iter {
///         let cf = f(accum, x).branch();
///         match cf {
///             ControlFlow::Continue(a) => accum = a,
///             ControlFlow::Break(r) => return R::from_residual(r),
///         }
///     }
///     R::from_output(accum)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// But this "call `branch`, then `match` on it, and `return` if it was a
/// `Break`" is exactly what happens inside the `?` operator.  So rather than
/// do all this manually, we can just use `?` instead:
/// ```

/* Core types and methods on primitives */

pub mod any {
//! This module contains the `Any` trait, which enables dynamic typing
//! of any `'static` type through runtime reflection. It also contains the
//! `Provider` trait and accompanying API, which enable trait objects to provide
//! data based on typed requests, an alternate form of runtime reflection.
//!
//! # `Any` and `TypeId`
//!
//! `Any` itself can be used to get a `TypeId`, and has more features when used
//! as a trait object. As `&dyn Any` (a borrowed trait object), it has the `is`
//! and `downcast_ref` methods, to test if the contained value is of a given type,
//! and to get a reference to the inner value as a type. As `&mut dyn Any`, there
//! is also the `downcast_mut` method, for getting a mutable reference to the
//! inner value. `Box<dyn Any>` adds the `downcast` method, which attempts to
//! convert to a `Box<T>`. See the [`Box`] documentation for the full details.
//!
//! Note that `&dyn Any` is limited to testing whether a value is of a specified
//! concrete type, and cannot be used to test whether a type implements a trait.
//!
//! [`Box`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html
//!
//! # Smart pointers and `dyn Any`
//!
//! One piece of behavior to keep in mind when using `Any` as a trait object,
//! especially with types like `Box<dyn Any>` or `Arc<dyn Any>`, is that simply
//! calling `.type_id()` on the value will produce the `TypeId` of the
//! *container*, not the underlying trait object. This can be avoided by
//! converting the smart pointer into a `&dyn Any` instead, which will return
//! the object's `TypeId`. For example:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::any::{Any, TypeId};
//!
//! let boxed: Box<dyn Any> = Box::new(3_i32);
//!
//! // You're more likely to want this:
//! let actual_id = (&*boxed).type_id();
//! // ... than this:
//! let boxed_id = boxed.type_id();
//!
//! assert_eq!(actual_id, TypeId::of::<i32>());
//! assert_eq!(boxed_id, TypeId::of::<Box<dyn Any>>());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! Consider a situation where we want to log out a value passed to a function.
//! We know the value we're working on implements Debug, but we don't know its
//! concrete type. We want to give special treatment to certain types: in this
//! case printing out the length of String values prior to their value.
//! We don't know the concrete type of our value at compile time, so we need to
//! use runtime reflection instead.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::fmt::Debug;
//! use std::any::Any;
//!
//! // Logger function for any type that implements Debug.
//! fn log<T: Any + Debug>(value: &T) {
//!     let value_any = value as &dyn Any;
//!
//!     // Try to convert our value to a `String`. If successful, we want to
//!     // output the String`'s length as well as its value. If not, it's a
//!     // different type: just print it out unadorned.
//!     match value_any.downcast_ref::<String>() {
//!         Some(as_string) => {
//!             println!("String ({}): {}", as_string.len(), as_string);
//!         }
//!         None => {
//!             println!("{value:?}");
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // This function wants to log its parameter out prior to doing work with it.
//! fn do_work<T: Any + Debug>(value: &T) {
//!     log(value);
//!     // ...do some other work
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let my_string = "Hello World".to_string();
//!     do_work(&my_string);
//!
//!     let my_i8: i8 = 100;
//!     do_work(&my_i8);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # `Provider` and `Demand`
//!
//! `Provider` and the associated APIs support generic, type-driven access to data, and a mechanism
//! for implementers to provide such data. The key parts of the interface are the `Provider`
//! trait for objects which can provide data, and the [`request_value`] and [`request_ref`]
//! functions for requesting data from an object which implements `Provider`. Generally, end users
//! should not call `request_*` directly, they are helper functions for intermediate implementers
//! to use to implement a user-facing interface. This is purely for the sake of ergonomics, there is
//! no safety concern here; intermediate implementers can typically support methods rather than
//! free functions and use more specific names.
//!
//! Typically, a data provider is a trait object of a trait which extends `Provider`. A user will
//! request data from a trait object by specifying the type of the data.
//!
//! ## Data flow
//!
//! * A user requests an object of a specific type, which is delegated to `request_value` or
//!   `request_ref`
//! * `request_*` creates a `Demand` object and passes it to `Provider::provide`
//! * The data provider's implementation of `Provider::provide` tries providing values of
//!   different types using `Demand::provide_*`. If the type matches the type requested by
//!   the user, the value will be stored in the `Demand` object.
//! * `request_*` unpacks the `Demand` object and returns any stored value to the user.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # #![feature(provide_any)]
//! use std::any::{Provider, Demand, request_ref};
//!
//! // Definition of MyTrait, a data provider.
//! trait MyTrait: Provider {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! // Methods on `MyTrait` trait objects.
//! impl dyn MyTrait + '_ {
//!     /// Get a reference to a field of the implementing struct.
//!     pub fn get_context_by_ref<T: ?Sized + 'static>(&self) -> Option<&T> {
//!         request_ref::<T>(self)
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Downstream implementation of `MyTrait` and `Provider`.
//! # struct SomeConcreteType { some_string: String }
//! impl MyTrait for SomeConcreteType {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! impl Provider for SomeConcreteType {
//!     fn provide<'a>(&'a self, demand: &mut Demand<'a>) {
//!         // Provide a string reference. We could provide multiple values with
//!         // different types here.
//!         demand.provide_ref::<String>(&self.some_string);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Downstream usage of `MyTrait`.
//! fn use_my_trait(obj: &dyn MyTrait) {
//!     // Request a &String from obj.
//!     let _ = obj.get_context_by_ref::<String>().unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, if the concrete type of `obj` in `use_my_trait` is `SomeConcreteType`, then
//! the `get_context_ref` call will return a reference to `obj.some_string` with type `&String`.

//! Shareable mutable containers.

//! Rust memory safety is based on this rule: Given an object `T`, it is only possible to
//! have one of the following:
//!
//! - Having several immutable references (`&T`) to the object (also known as **aliasing**).
//! - Having one mutable reference (`&mut T`) to the object (also known as **mutability**).
//!
//! This is enforced by the Rust compiler. However, there are situations where this rule is not
//! flexible enough. Sometimes it is required to have multiple references to an object and yet
//! mutate it.
//!
//! Shareable mutable containers exist to permit mutability in a controlled manner, even in the
//! presence of aliasing. Both [`Cell<T>`] and [`RefCell<T>`] allow doing this in a single-threaded
//! way. However, neither `Cell<T>` nor `RefCell<T>` are thread safe (they do not implement
//! [`Sync`]). If you need to do aliasing and mutation between multiple threads it is possible to
//! use [`Mutex<T>`], [`RwLock<T>`] or [`atomic`] types.
//!
//! Values of the `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` types may be mutated through shared references (i.e.
//! the common `&T` type), whereas most Rust types can only be mutated through unique (`&mut T`)
//! references. We say that `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` provide 'interior mutability', in contrast
//! with typical Rust types that exhibit 'inherited mutability'.

//! Cell types come in two flavors: `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>`. `Cell<T>` implements interior
//! mutability by moving values in and out of the `Cell<T>`. To use references instead of values,
//! one must use the `RefCell<T>` type, acquiring a write lock before mutating. `Cell<T>` provides
//! methods to retrieve and change the current interior value:
//!
//!  - For types that implement [`Copy`], the [`get`](Cell::get) method retrieves the current
//!    interior value.
//!  - For types that implement [`Default`], the [`take`](Cell::take) method replaces the current
//!    interior value with [`Default::default()`] and returns the replaced value.
//!  - For all types, the [`replace`](Cell::replace) method replaces the current interior value and
//!    returns the replaced value and the [`into_inner`](Cell::into_inner) method consumes the
//!    `Cell<T>` and returns the interior value. Additionally, the [`set`](Cell::set) method
//!    replaces the interior value, dropping the replaced value.
//!
//! `RefCell<T>` uses Rust's lifetimes to implement 'dynamic borrowing', a process whereby one can
//! claim temporary, exclusive, mutable access to the inner value. Borrows for `RefCell<T>`s are
//! tracked 'at runtime', unlike Rust's native reference types which are entirely tracked
//! statically, at compile time. Because `RefCell<T>` borrows are dynamic it is possible to attempt
//! to borrow a value that is already mutably borrowed; when this happens it results in thread
//! panic.
//!
//! # When to choose interior mutability
//!
//! The more common inherited mutability, where one must have unique access to mutate a value, is
//! one of the key language elements that enables Rust to reason strongly about pointer aliasing,
//! statically preventing crash bugs. Because of that, inherited mutability is preferred, and
//! interior mutability is something of a last resort. Since cell types enable mutation where it
//! would otherwise be disallowed though, there are occasions when interior mutability might be
//! appropriate, or even *must* be used, e.g.
//!
//! * Introducing mutability 'inside' of something immutable
//! * Implementation details of logically-immutable methods.
//! * Mutating implementations of [`Clone`].
//!
//! ## Introducing mutability 'inside' of something immutable
//!
//! Many shared smart pointer types, including [`Rc<T>`] and [`Arc<T>`], provide containers that can
//! be cloned and shared between multiple parties. Because the contained values may be
//! multiply-aliased, they can only be borrowed with `&`, not `&mut`. Without cells it would be
//! impossible to mutate data inside of these smart pointers at all.
//!
//! It's very common then to put a `RefCell<T>` inside shared pointer types to reintroduce
//! mutability:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::{RefCell, RefMut};
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let shared_map: Rc<RefCell<_>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(HashMap::new()));
//!     // Create a new block to limit the scope of the dynamic borrow
//!     {
//!         let mut map: RefMut<_> = shared_map.borrow_mut();
//!         map.insert("africa", 92388);
//!         map.insert("kyoto", 11837);
//!         map.insert("piccadilly", 11826);
//!         map.insert("marbles", 38);
//!     }
//!
//!     // Note that if we had not let the previous borrow of the cache fall out
//!     // of scope then the subsequent borrow would cause a dynamic thread panic.
//!     // This is the major hazard of using `RefCell`.
//!     let total: i32 = shared_map.borrow().values().sum();
//!     println!("{total}");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that this example uses `Rc<T>` and not `Arc<T>`. `RefCell<T>`s are for single-threaded
//! scenarios. Consider using [`RwLock<T>`] or [`Mutex<T>`] if you need shared mutability in a
//! multi-threaded situation.
//!
//! ## Implementation details of logically-immutable methods
//!
//! Occasionally it may be desirable not to expose in an API that there is mutation happening
//! "under the hood". This may be because logically the operation is immutable, but e.g., caching
//! forces the implementation to perform mutation; or because you must employ mutation to implement
//! a trait method that was originally defined to take `&self`.
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(dead_code)]
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! struct Graph {
//!     edges: Vec<(i32, i32)>,
//!     span_tree_cache: RefCell<Option<Vec<(i32, i32)>>>
//! }
//!
//! impl Graph {
//!     fn minimum_spanning_tree(&self) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> {
//!         self.span_tree_cache.borrow_mut()
//!             .get_or_insert_with(|| self.calc_span_tree())
//!             .clone()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn calc_span_tree(&self) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> {
//!         // Expensive computation goes here
//!         vec![]
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Mutating implementations of `Clone`
//!
//! This is simply a special - but common - case of the previous: hiding mutability for operations
//! that appear to be immutable. The [`clone`](Clone::clone) method is expected to not change the
//! source value, and is declared to take `&self`, not `&mut self`. Therefore, any mutation that
//! happens in the `clone` method must use cell types. For example, [`Rc<T>`] maintains its
//! reference counts within a `Cell<T>`.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::Cell;
//! use std::ptr::NonNull;
//! use std::process::abort;
//! use std::marker::PhantomData;
//!
//! struct Rc<T: ?Sized> {
//!     ptr: NonNull<RcBox<T>>,
//!     phantom: PhantomData<RcBox<T>>,
//! }

//!     strong: Cell<usize>,
//!     refcount: Cell<usize>,
//!     value: T,
//! }
//!
//! impl<T: ?Sized> Clone for Rc<T> {
//!     fn clone(&self) -> Rc<T> {
//!         self.inc_strong();
//!         Rc {
//!             ptr: self.ptr,
//!             phantom: PhantomData,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! trait RcBoxPtr<T: ?Sized> {
//!
//!     fn inner(&self) -> &RcBox<T>;
//!
//!     fn strong(&self) -> usize {
//!         self.inner().strong.get()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn inc_strong(&self) {
//!         self.inner()
//!             .strong
//!             .set(self.strong()
//!                      .checked_add(1)
//!                      .unwrap_or_else(|| abort() ));

pub mod iter {
//! Composable external iteration.
//!
//! If you've found yourself with a collection of some kind, and needed to
//! perform an operation on the elements of said collection, you'll quickly run
//! into 'iterators'. Iterators are heavily used in idiomatic Rust code, so
//! it's worth becoming familiar with them.
//!
//! Before explaining more, let's talk about how this module is structured:
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! This module is largely organized by type:
//!
//! * [Traits] are the core portion: these traits define what kind of iterators
//!   exist and what you can do with them. The methods of these traits are worth
//!   putting some extra study time into.
//! * [Functions] provide some helpful ways to create some basic iterators.
//! * [Structs] are often the return types of the various methods on this
//!   module's traits. You'll usually want to look at the method that creates
//!   the `struct`, rather than the `struct` itself. For more detail about why,
//!   see '[Implementing Iterator](#implementing-iterator)'.
//!
//! [Traits]: #traits
//! [Functions]: #functions
//! [Structs]: #structs
//!
//! That's it! Let's dig into iterators.
//!
//! # Iterator
//!
//! The heart and soul of this module is the [`Iterator`] trait. The core of
//! [`Iterator`] looks like this:
//!
//! ```
//! trait Iterator {
//!     type Item;
//!     fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! An iterator has a method, [`next`], which when called, returns an
//! <code>[Option]\<Item></code>. Calling [`next`] will return [`Some(Item)`] as long as there
//! are elements, and once they've all been exhausted, will return `None` to
//! indicate that iteration is finished. Individual iterators may choose to
//! resume iteration, and so calling [`next`] again may or may not eventually
//! start returning [`Some(Item)`] again at some point (for example, see [`TryIter`]).
//!
//! [`Iterator`]'s full definition includes a number of other methods as well,
//! but they are default methods, built on top of [`next`], and so you get
//! them for free.
//!
//! Iterators are also composable, and it's common to chain them together to do
//! more complex forms of processing. See the [Adapters](#adapters) section
//! below for more details.
//!
//! [`Some(Item)`]: Some
//! [`next`]: Iterator::next
//! [`TryIter`]: ../../std/sync/mpsc/struct.TryIter.html
//!
//! # The three forms of iteration
//!
//! There are three common methods which can create iterators from a collection:
//!
//! * `iter()`, which iterates over `&T`.
//! * `iter_mut()`, which iterates over `&mut T`.
//! * `into_iter()`, which iterates over `T`.
//!
//! Various things in the standard library may implement one or more of the
//! three, where appropriate.
//!
//! # Implementing Iterator
//!
//! Creating an iterator of your own involves two steps: creating a `struct` to
//! hold the iterator's state, and then implementing [`Iterator`] for that `struct`.
//! This is why there are so many `struct`s in this module: there is one for
//! each iterator and iterator adapter.
//!
//! Let's make an iterator named `Counter` which counts from `1` to `5`:
//!
//! ```
//! // First, the struct:
//!
//! /// An iterator which counts from one to five
//! struct Counter {
//!     count: usize,
//! }
//!
//! // we want our count to start at one, so let's add a new() method to help.
//! // This isn't strictly necessary, but is convenient. Note that we start
//! // `count` at zero, we'll see why in `next()`'s implementation below.
//! impl Counter {
//!     fn new() -> Counter {
//!         Counter { count: 0 }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Then, we implement `Iterator` for our `Counter`:
//!
//! impl Iterator for Counter {
//!     // we will be counting with usize
//!     type Item = usize;
//!
//!     // next() is the only required method
//!     fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
//!         // Increment our count. This is why we started at zero.
//!         self.count += 1;
//!
//!         // Check to see if we've finished counting or not.
//!         if self.count < 6 {
//!             Some(self.count)
//!         } else {
//!             None
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // And now we can use it!
//!
//! let mut counter = Counter::new();
//!
//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(1));
//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(2));
//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(3));
//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(4));
//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(5));
//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), None);
//! ```
//!
//! Calling [`next`] this way gets repetitive. Rust has a construct which can
//! call [`next`] on your iterator, until it reaches `None`. Let's go over that
//! next.
//!
//! Also note that `Iterator` provides a default implementation of methods such as `nth` and `fold`
//! which call `next` internally. However, it is also possible to write a custom implementation of
//! methods like `nth` and `fold` if an iterator can compute them more efficiently without calling
//! `next`.
//!
//! # `for` loops and `IntoIterator`
//!
//! Rust's `for` loop syntax is actually sugar for iterators. Here's a basic
//! example of `for`:
//!
//! ```
//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//!
//! for x in values {
//!     println!("{x}");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This will print the numbers one through five, each on their own line. But
//! you'll notice something here: we never called anything on our vector to
//! produce an iterator. What gives?
//!
//! There's a trait in the standard library for converting something into an
//! iterator: [`IntoIterator`]. This trait has one method, [`into_iter`],
//! which converts the thing implementing [`IntoIterator`] into an iterator.
//! Let's take a look at that `for` loop again, and what the compiler converts
//! it into:
//!
//! [`into_iter`]: IntoIterator::into_iter
//!
//! ```
//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//!
//! for x in values {
//!     println!("{x}");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Rust de-sugars this into:
//!
//! ```
//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! {
//!     let result = match IntoIterator::into_iter(values) {
//!         mut iter => loop {
//!             let next;
//!             match iter.next() {
//!                 Some(val) => next = val,
//!                 None => break,
//!             };
//!             let x = next;
//!             let () = { println!("{x}"); };
//!         },
//!     };
//!     result
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! First, we call `into_iter()` on the value. Then, we match on the iterator
//! that returns, calling [`next`] over and over until we see a `None`. At
//! that point, we `break` out of the loop, and we're done iterating.
//!
//! There's one more subtle bit here: the standard library contains an
//! interesting implementation of [`IntoIterator`]:
//!
//! ```ignore (only-for-syntax-highlight)
//! impl<I: Iterator> IntoIterator for I
//! ```
//!
//! In other words, all [`Iterator`]s implement [`IntoIterator`], by just
//! returning themselves. This means two things:
//!
//! 1. If you're writing an [`Iterator`], you can use it with a `for` loop.
//! 2. If you're creating a collection, implementing [`IntoIterator`] for it
//!    will allow your collection to be used with the `for` loop.
//!
//! # Iterating by reference
//!
//! Since [`into_iter()`] takes `self` by value, using a `for` loop to iterate
//! over a collection consumes that collection. Often, you may want to iterate
//! over a collection without consuming it. Many collections offer methods that
//! provide iterators over references, conventionally called `iter()` and
//! `iter_mut()` respectively:
//!
//! ```
//! let mut values = vec![41];
//! for x in values.iter_mut() {
//!     *x += 1;
//! }
//! for x in values.iter() {
//!     assert_eq!(*x, 42);
//! }
//! assert_eq!(values.len(), 1); // `values` is still owned by this function.
//! ```
//!
//! If a collection type `C` provides `iter()`, it usually also implements
//! `IntoIterator` for `&C`, with an implementation that just calls `iter()`.
//! Likewise, a collection `C` that provides `iter_mut()` generally implements
//! `IntoIterator` for `&mut C` by delegating to `iter_mut()`. This enables a
//! convenient shorthand:
//!
//! ```
//! let mut values = vec![41];
//! for x in &mut values { // same as `values.iter_mut()`
//!     *x += 1;
//! }
//! for x in &values { // same as `values.iter()`
//!     assert_eq!(*x, 42);
//! }
//! assert_eq!(values.len(), 1);
//! ```
//!
//! While many collections offer `iter()`, not all offer `iter_mut()`. For
//! example, mutating the keys of a [`HashSet<T>`] could put the collection
//! into an inconsistent state if the key hashes change, so this collection
//! only offers `iter()`.
//!
//! [`into_iter()`]: IntoIterator::into_iter
//! [`HashSet<T>`]: ../../std/collections/struct.HashSet.html
//!
//! # Adapters
//!
//! Functions which take an [`Iterator`] and return another [`Iterator`] are
//! often called 'iterator adapters', as they're a form of the 'adapter
//! pattern'.
//!
//! Common iterator adapters include [`map`], [`take`], and [`filter`].
//! For more, see their documentation.
//!
//! If an iterator adapter panics, the iterator will be in an unspecified (but
//! memory safe) state.  This state is also not guaranteed to stay the same
//! across versions of Rust, so you should avoid relying on the exact values
//! returned by an iterator which panicked.
//!
//! [`map`]: Iterator::map
//! [`take`]: Iterator::take
//! [`filter`]: Iterator::filter
//!
//! # Laziness
//!
//! Iterators (and iterator [adapters](#adapters)) are *lazy*. This means that
//! just creating an iterator doesn't _do_ a whole lot. Nothing really happens
//! until you call [`next`]. This is sometimes a source of confusion when
//! creating an iterator solely for its side effects. For example, the [`map`]
//! method calls a closure on each element it iterates over:
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(unused_must_use)]
//! let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//! v.iter().map(|x| println!("{x}"));
//! ```
//!
//! This will not print any values, as we only created an iterator, rather than
//! using it. The compiler will warn us about this kind of behavior:
//!
//! ```text
//! warning: unused result that must be used: iterators are lazy and
//! do nothing unless consumed
//! ```
//!
//! The idiomatic way to write a [`map`] for its side effects is to use a
//! `for` loop or call the [`for_each`] method:
//!
//! ```
//! let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//!
//! v.iter().for_each(|x| println!("{x}"));
//! // or
//! for x in &v {
//!     println!("{x}");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`map`]: Iterator::map
//! [`for_each`]: Iterator::for_each
//!
//! Another common way to evaluate an iterator is to use the [`collect`]
//! method to produce a new collection.
//!
//! [`collect`]: Iterator::collect
//!
//! # Infinity
//!
//! Iterators do not have to be finite. As an example, an open-ended range is
//! an infinite iterator:
//!
//! ```
//! let numbers = 0..;
//! ```
//!
//! It is common to use the [`take`] iterator adapter to turn an infinite
//! iterator into a finite one:
//!
//! ```
//! let numbers = 0..;
//! let five_numbers = numbers.take(5);
//!
//! for number in five_numbers {
//!     println!("{number}");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This will print the numbers `0` through `4`, each on their own line.
//!
//! Bear in mind that methods on infinite iterators, even those for which a
//! result can be determined mathematically in finite time, might not terminate.
//! Specifically, methods such as [`min`], which in the general case require
//! traversing every element in the iterator, are likely not to return
//! successfully for any infinite iterators.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! let ones = std::iter::repeat(1);
//! let least = ones.min().unwrap(); // Oh no! An infinite loop!
//! // `ones.min()` causes an infinite loop, so we won't reach this point!
//! println!("The smallest number one is {least}.");
//! ```
//!
//! [`take`]: Iterator::take
//! [`min`]: Iterator::min

/// ```rust
/// let mut c = 0;

/// Now consider this twist where we add a call to `rev`. This version will

/// let mut c = 0;

/// # Safety
///
/// The iterator's `size_hint` must be exact and cheap to call.
///
/// `TrustedRandomAccessNoCoerce::size` may not be overridden.
///
/// All subtypes and all supertypes of `Self` must also implement `TrustedRandomAccess`.
/// In particular, this means that types with non-invariant parameters usually can not have
/// an impl for `TrustedRandomAccess` that depends on any trait bounds on such parameters, except
/// for bounds that come from the respective struct/enum definition itself, or bounds involving
/// traits that themselves come with a guarantee similar to this one.
///
/// If `Self: ExactSizeIterator` then `self.len()` must always produce results consistent
/// with `self.size()`.
///
/// If `Self: Iterator`, then `<Self as Iterator>::__iterator_get_unchecked(&mut self, idx)`
/// must be safe to call provided the following conditions are met.
///
/// 1. `0 <= idx` and `idx < self.size()`.
/// 2. If `Self: !Clone`, then `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` is never called with the same
///    index on `self` more than once.
/// 3. After `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` has been called, then `self.next_back()` will
///    only be called at most `self.size() - idx - 1` times. If `Self: Clone` and `self` is cloned,
///    then this number is calculated for `self` and its clone individually,
///    but `self.next_back()` calls that happened before the cloning count for both `self` and the clone.
/// 4. After `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` has been called, then only the following methods
///    will be called on `self` or on any new clones of `self`:
///     * `std::clone::Clone::clone`
///     * `std::iter::Iterator::size_hint`
///     * `std::iter::DoubleEndedIterator::next_back`
///     * `std::iter::ExactSizeIterator::len`
///     * `std::iter::Iterator::__iterator_get_unchecked`
///     * `std::iter::TrustedRandomAccessNoCoerce::size`
/// 5. If `T` is a subtype of `Self`, then `self` is allowed to be coerced
///    to `T`. If `self` is coerced to `T` after `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` has already
///    been called, then no methods except for the ones listed under 4. are allowed to be called
///    on the resulting value of type `T`, either. Multiple such coercion steps are allowed.
///    Regarding 2. and 3., the number of times `__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)` or `next_back()` is
///    called on `self` and the resulting value of type `T` (and on further coercion results with
///    sub-subtypes) are added together and their sums must not exceed the specified bounds.
///
/// Further, given that these conditions are met, it must guarantee that:
///
/// * It does not change the value returned from `size_hint`
/// * It must be safe to call the methods listed above on `self` after calling
///   `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)`, assuming that the required traits are implemented.
/// * It must also be safe to drop `self` after calling `self.__iterator_get_unchecked(idx)`.
/// * If `T` is a subtype of `Self`, then it must be safe to coerce `self` to `T`.
//
// FIXME: Clarify interaction with SourceIter/InPlaceIterable. Calling `SourceIter::as_inner`

//! [Box\<T>]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html
//!
//! The following example uses [`Option`] to create an optional box of
//! [`i32`]. Notice that in order to use the inner [`i32`] value, the
//! `check_optional` function first needs to use pattern matching to
//! determine whether the box has a value (i.e., it is [`Some(...)`][`Some`]) or
//! not ([`None`]).
//!
//! ```
//! let optional = None;
//! check_optional(optional);
//!
//! let optional = Some(Box::new(9000));
//! check_optional(optional);
//!
//! fn check_optional(optional: Option<Box<i32>>) {
//!     match optional {
//!         Some(p) => println!("has value {p}"),
//!         None => println!("has no value"),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! Rust guarantees to optimize the following types `T` such that
//! [`Option<T>`] has the same size as `T`:
//!
//! * [`Box<U>`]
//! * `&U`
//! * `&mut U`
//! * `fn`, `extern "C" fn`[^extern_fn]
//! * [`num::NonZero*`]
//! * [`ptr::NonNull<U>`]
//! * `#[repr(transparent)]` struct around one of the types in this list.
//!
//! [^extern_fn]: this remains true for any other ABI: `extern "abi" fn` (_e.g._, `extern "system" fn`)
//!
//! [`Box<U>`]: ../../std/boxed/struct.Box.html
//! [`num::NonZero*`]: crate::num
//! [`ptr::NonNull<U>`]: crate::ptr::NonNull
//!
//! This is called the "null pointer optimization" or NPO.
//!
//! It is further guaranteed that, for the cases above, one can
//! [`mem::transmute`] from all valid values of `T` to `Option<T>` and
//! from `Some::<T>(_)` to `T` (but transmuting `None::<T>` to `T`
//! is undefined behaviour).
//!
//! # Method overview
//!
//! In addition to working with pattern matching, [`Option`] provides a wide
//! variety of different methods.
//!
//! ## Querying the variant
//!
//! The [`is_some`] and [`is_none`] methods return [`true`] if the [`Option`]
//! is [`Some`] or [`None`], respectively.
//!
//! [`is_none`]: Option::is_none
//! [`is_some`]: Option::is_some
//!
//! ## Adapters for working with references
//!
//! * [`as_ref`] converts from <code>[&][][Option]\<T></code> to <code>[Option]<[&]T></code>
//! * [`as_mut`] converts from <code>[&mut] [Option]\<T></code> to <code>[Option]<[&mut] T></code>
//! * [`as_deref`] converts from <code>[&][][Option]\<T></code> to
//!   <code>[Option]<[&]T::[Target]></code>
//! * [`as_deref_mut`] converts from <code>[&mut] [Option]\<T></code> to
//!   <code>[Option]<[&mut] T::[Target]></code>
//! * [`as_pin_ref`] converts from <code>[Pin]<[&][][Option]\<T>></code> to
//!   <code>[Option]<[Pin]<[&]T>></code>
//! * [`as_pin_mut`] converts from <code>[Pin]<[&mut] [Option]\<T>></code> to
//!   <code>[Option]<[Pin]<[&mut] T>></code>
//!
//! [&]: reference "shared reference"
//! [&mut]: reference "mutable reference"
//! [Target]: Deref::Target "ops::Deref::Target"
//! [`as_deref`]: Option::as_deref
//! [`as_deref_mut`]: Option::as_deref_mut
//! [`as_mut`]: Option::as_mut
//! [`as_pin_mut`]: Option::as_pin_mut
//! [`as_pin_ref`]: Option::as_pin_ref
//! [`as_ref`]: Option::as_ref
//!
//! ## Extracting the contained value
//!
//! These methods extract the contained value in an [`Option<T>`] when it
//! is the [`Some`] variant. If the [`Option`] is [`None`]:
//!
//! * [`expect`] panics with a provided custom message
//! * [`unwrap`] panics with a generic message
//! * [`unwrap_or`] returns the provided default value
//! * [`unwrap_or_default`] returns the default value of the type `T`
//!   (which must implement the [`Default`] trait)
//! * [`unwrap_or_else`] returns the result of evaluating the provided
//!   function
//!
//! [`expect`]: Option::expect
//! [`unwrap`]: Option::unwrap
//! [`unwrap_or`]: Option::unwrap_or
//! [`unwrap_or_default`]: Option::unwrap_or_default
//! [`unwrap_or_else`]: Option::unwrap_or_else
//!
//! ## Transforming contained values
//!
//! These methods transform [`Option`] to [`Result`]:
//!
//! * [`ok_or`] transforms [`Some(v)`] to [`Ok(v)`], and [`None`] to
//!   [`Err(err)`] using the provided default `err` value
//! * [`ok_or_else`] transforms [`Some(v)`] to [`Ok(v)`], and [`None`] to
//!   a value of [`Err`] using the provided function
//! * [`transpose`] transposes an [`Option`] of a [`Result`] into a
//!   [`Result`] of an [`Option`]
//!
//! [`Err(err)`]: Err
//! [`Ok(v)`]: Ok
//! [`Some(v)`]: Some
//! [`ok_or`]: Option::ok_or
//! [`ok_or_else`]: Option::ok_or_else
//! [`transpose`]: Option::transpose
//!
//! These methods transform the [`Some`] variant:
//!
//! * [`filter`] calls the provided predicate function on the contained
//!   value `t` if the [`Option`] is [`Some(t)`], and returns [`Some(t)`]
//!   if the function returns `true`; otherwise, returns [`None`]
//! * [`flatten`] removes one level of nesting from an
//!   [`Option<Option<T>>`]
//! * [`map`] transforms [`Option<T>`] to [`Option<U>`] by applying the
//!   provided function to the contained value of [`Some`] and leaving
//!   [`None`] values unchanged
//!
//! [`Some(t)`]: Some
//! [`filter`]: Option::filter
//! [`flatten`]: Option::flatten
//! [`map`]: Option::map
//!
//! These methods transform [`Option<T>`] to a value of a possibly
//! different type `U`:
//!
//! * [`map_or`] applies the provided function to the contained value of
//!   [`Some`], or returns the provided default value if the [`Option`] is
//!   [`None`]
//! * [`map_or_else`] applies the provided function to the contained value
//!   of [`Some`], or returns the result of evaluating the provided
//!   fallback function if the [`Option`] is [`None`]
//!
//! [`map_or`]: Option::map_or
//! [`map_or_else`]: Option::map_or_else
//!
//! These methods combine the [`Some`] variants of two [`Option`] values:
//!
//! * [`zip`] returns [`Some((s, o))`] if `self` is [`Some(s)`] and the
//!   provided [`Option`] value is [`Some(o)`]; otherwise, returns [`None`]
//! * [`zip_with`] calls the provided function `f` and returns
//!   [`Some(f(s, o))`] if `self` is [`Some(s)`] and the provided
//!   [`Option`] value is [`Some(o)`]; otherwise, returns [`None`]
//!
//! [`Some(f(s, o))`]: Some
//! [`Some(o)`]: Some
//! [`Some(s)`]: Some
//! [`Some((s, o))`]: Some
//! [`zip`]: Option::zip
//! [`zip_with`]: Option::zip_with
//!
//! ## Boolean operators
//!
//! These methods treat the [`Option`] as a boolean value, where [`Some`]
//! acts like [`true`] and [`None`] acts like [`false`]. There are two
//! categories of these methods: ones that take an [`Option`] as input, and
//! ones that take a function as input (to be lazily evaluated).
//!
//! The [`and`], [`or`], and [`xor`] methods take another [`Option`] as
//! input, and produce an [`Option`] as output. Only the [`and`] method can
//! produce an [`Option<U>`] value having a different inner type `U` than
//! [`Option<T>`].
//!
//! | method  | self      | input     | output    |
//! |---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
//! | [`and`] | `None`    | (ignored) | `None`    |
//! | [`and`] | `Some(x)` | `None`    | `None`    |
//! | [`and`] | `Some(x)` | `Some(y)` | `Some(y)` |
//! | [`or`]  | `None`    | `None`    | `None`    |
//! | [`or`]  | `None`    | `Some(y)` | `Some(y)` |
//! | [`or`]  | `Some(x)` | (ignored) | `Some(x)` |
//! | [`xor`] | `None`    | `None`    | `None`    |
//! | [`xor`] | `None`    | `Some(y)` | `Some(y)` |
//! | [`xor`] | `Some(x)` | `None`    | `Some(x)` |
//! | [`xor`] | `Some(x)` | `Some(y)` | `None`    |
//!
//! [`and`]: Option::and
//! [`or`]: Option::or
//! [`xor`]: Option::xor
//!
//! The [`and_then`] and [`or_else`] methods take a function as input, and
//! only evaluate the function when they need to produce a new value. Only
//! the [`and_then`] method can produce an [`Option<U>`] value having a
//! different inner type `U` than [`Option<T>`].
//!
//! | method       | self      | function input | function result | output    |
//! |--------------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
//! | [`and_then`] | `None`    | (not provided) | (not evaluated) | `None`    |
//! | [`and_then`] | `Some(x)` | `x`            | `None`          | `None`    |
//! | [`and_then`] | `Some(x)` | `x`            | `Some(y)`       | `Some(y)` |
//! | [`or_else`]  | `None`    | (not provided) | `None`          | `None`    |
//! | [`or_else`]  | `None`    | (not provided) | `Some(y)`       | `Some(y)` |
//! | [`or_else`]  | `Some(x)` | (not provided) | (not evaluated) | `Some(x)` |
//!
//! [`and_then`]: Option::and_then
//! [`or_else`]: Option::or_else
//!
//! This is an example of using methods like [`and_then`] and [`or`] in a
//! pipeline of method calls. Early stages of the pipeline pass failure
//! values ([`None`]) through unchanged, and continue processing on
//! success values ([`Some`]). Toward the end, [`or`] substitutes an error
//! message if it receives [`None`].
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::collections::BTreeMap;
//! let mut bt = BTreeMap::new();
//! bt.insert(20u8, "foo");
//! bt.insert(42u8, "bar");
//! let res = [0u8, 1, 11, 200, 22]
//!     .into_iter()
//!     .map(|x| {
//!         // `checked_sub()` returns `None` on error
//!         x.checked_sub(1)
//!             // same with `checked_mul()`
//!             .and_then(|x| x.checked_mul(2))
//!             // `BTreeMap::get` returns `None` on error
//!             .and_then(|x| bt.get(&x))
//!             // Substitute an error message if we have `None` so far
//!             .or(Some(&"error!"))
//!             .copied()
//!             // Won't panic because we unconditionally used `Some` above
//!             .unwrap()
//!     })
//!     .collect::<Vec<_>>();
//! assert_eq!(res, ["error!", "error!", "foo", "error!", "bar"]);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Comparison operators
//!
//! If `T` implements [`PartialOrd`] then [`Option<T>`] will derive its
//! [`PartialOrd`] implementation.  With this order, [`None`] compares as
//! less than any [`Some`], and two [`Some`] compare the same way as their
//! contained values would in `T`.  If `T` also implements
//! [`Ord`], then so does [`Option<T>`].
//!
//! ```
//! assert!(None < Some(0));
//! assert!(Some(0) < Some(1));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Iterating over `Option`
//!
//! An [`Option`] can be iterated over. This can be helpful if you need an
//! iterator that is conditionally empty. The iterator will either produce
//! a single value (when the [`Option`] is [`Some`]), or produce no values
//! (when the [`Option`] is [`None`]). For example, [`into_iter`] acts like
//! [`once(v)`] if the [`Option`] is [`Some(v)`], and like [`empty()`] if
//! the [`Option`] is [`None`].
//!
//! [`Some(v)`]: Some
//! [`empty()`]: crate::iter::empty
//! [`once(v)`]: crate::iter::once
//!
//! Iterators over [`Option<T>`] come in three types:
//!
//! * [`into_iter`] consumes the [`Option`] and produces the contained
//!   value
//! * [`iter`] produces an immutable reference of type `&T` to the
//!   contained value
//! * [`iter_mut`] produces a mutable reference of type `&mut T` to the
//!   contained value
//!
//! [`into_iter`]: Option::into_iter
//! [`iter`]: Option::iter
//! [`iter_mut`]: Option::iter_mut
//!
//! An iterator over [`Option`] can be useful when chaining iterators, for
//! example, to conditionally insert items. (It's not always necessary to
//! explicitly call an iterator constructor: many [`Iterator`] methods that
//! accept other iterators will also accept iterable types that implement
//! [`IntoIterator`], which includes [`Option`].)
//!
//! ```
//! let yep = Some(42);
//! let nope = None;
//! // chain() already calls into_iter(), so we don't have to do so
//! let nums: Vec<i32> = (0..4).chain(yep).chain(4..8).collect();
//! assert_eq!(nums, [0, 1, 2, 3, 42, 4, 5, 6, 7]);
//! let nums: Vec<i32> = (0..4).chain(nope).chain(4..8).collect();
//! assert_eq!(nums, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]);
//! ```
//!
//! One reason to chain iterators in this way is that a function returning
//! `impl Iterator` must have all possible return values be of the same
//! concrete type. Chaining an iterated [`Option`] can help with that.
//!
//! ```
//! fn make_iter(do_insert: bool) -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
//!     // Explicit returns to illustrate return types matching
//!     match do_insert {
//!         true => return (0..4).chain(Some(42)).chain(4..8),
//!         false => return (0..4).chain(None).chain(4..8),
//!     }
//! }
//! println!("{:?}", make_iter(true).collect::<Vec<_>>());
//! println!("{:?}", make_iter(false).collect::<Vec<_>>());
//! ```
//!
//! If we try to do the same thing, but using [`once()`] and [`empty()`],
//! we can't return `impl Iterator` anymore because the concrete types of
//! the return values differ.
//!
//! [`empty()`]: crate::iter::empty
//! [`once()`]: crate::iter::once
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0308
//! # use std::iter::{empty, once};
//! // This won't compile because all possible returns from the function
//! // must have the same concrete type.
//! fn make_iter(do_insert: bool) -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
//!     // Explicit returns to illustrate return types not matching
//!     match do_insert {
//!         true => return (0..4).chain(once(42)).chain(4..8),
//!         false => return (0..4).chain(empty()).chain(4..8),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Collecting into `Option`
//!
//! [`Option`] implements the [`FromIterator`][impl-FromIterator] trait,
//! which allows an iterator over [`Option`] values to be collected into an
//! [`Option`] of a collection of each contained value of the original
//! [`Option`] values, or [`None`] if any of the elements was [`None`].
//!
//! [impl-FromIterator]: Option#impl-FromIterator%3COption%3CA%3E%3E-for-Option%3CV%3E
//!
//! ```
//! let v = [Some(2), Some(4), None, Some(8)];
//! let res: Option<Vec<_>> = v.into_iter().collect();
//! assert_eq!(res, None);
//! let v = [Some(2), Some(4), Some(8)];
//! let res: Option<Vec<_>> = v.into_iter().collect();
//! assert_eq!(res, Some(vec![2, 4, 8]));
//! ```
//!
//! [`Option`] also implements the [`Product`][impl-Product] and
//! [`Sum`][impl-Sum] traits, allowing an iterator over [`Option`] values
//! to provide the [`product`][Iterator::product] and
//! [`sum`][Iterator::sum] methods.
//!
//! [impl-Product]: Option#impl-Product%3COption%3CU%3E%3E-for-Option%3CT%3E
//! [impl-Sum]: Option#impl-Sum%3COption%3CU%3E%3E-for-Option%3CT%3E
//!
//! ```
//! let v = [None, Some(1), Some(2), Some(3)];
//! let res: Option<i32> = v.into_iter().sum();
//! assert_eq!(res, None);
//! let v = [Some(1), Some(2), Some(21)];
//! let res: Option<i32> = v.into_iter().product();
//! assert_eq!(res, Some(42));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Modifying an [`Option`] in-place
//!
//! These methods return a mutable reference to the contained value of an
//! [`Option<T>`]:
//!
//! * [`insert`] inserts a value, dropping any old contents
//! * [`get_or_insert`] gets the current value, inserting a provided
//!   default value if it is [`None`]
//! * [`get_or_insert_default`] gets the current value, inserting the
//!   default value of type `T` (which must implement [`Default`]) if it is
//!   [`None`]
//! * [`get_or_insert_with`] gets the current value, inserting a default
//!   computed by the provided function if it is [`None`]
//!
//! [`get_or_insert`]: Option::get_or_insert
//! [`get_or_insert_default`]: Option::get_or_insert_default
//! [`get_or_insert_with`]: Option::get_or_insert_with
//! [`insert`]: Option::insert
//!
//! These methods transfer ownership of the contained value of an
//! [`Option`]:
//!
//! * [`take`] takes ownership of the contained value of an [`Option`], if
//!   any, replacing the [`Option`] with [`None`]
//! * [`replace`] takes ownership of the contained value of an [`Option`],
//!   if any, replacing the [`Option`] with a [`Some`] containing the
//!   provided value
//!
//! [`replace`]: Option::replace
//! [`take`]: Option::take
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Basic pattern matching on [`Option`]:
//!
//! ```
//! let msg = Some("howdy");
//!
//! // Take a reference to the contained string
//! if let Some(m) = &msg {
//!     println!("{}", *m);
//! }
//!
//! // Remove the contained string, destroying the Option
//! let unwrapped_msg = msg.unwrap_or("default message");
//! ```
//!
//! Initialize a result to [`None`] before a loop:
//!
//! ```
//! enum Kingdom { Plant(u32, &'static str), Animal(u32, &'static str) }
//!
//! // A list of data to search through.
//! let all_the_big_things = [
//!     Kingdom::Plant(250, "redwood"),
//!     Kingdom::Plant(230, "noble fir"),
//!     Kingdom::Plant(229, "sugar pine"),
//!     Kingdom::Animal(25, "blue whale"),
//!     Kingdom::Animal(19, "fin whale"),
//!     Kingdom::Animal(15, "north pacific right whale"),
//! ];
//!
//! // We're going to search for the name of the biggest animal,
//! // but to start with we've just got `None`.
//! let mut name_of_biggest_animal = None;
//! let mut size_of_biggest_animal = 0;
//! for big_thing in &all_the_big_things {
//!     match *big_thing {
//!         Kingdom::Animal(size, name) if size > size_of_biggest_animal => {
//!             // Now we've found the name of some big animal
//!             size_of_biggest_animal = size;
//!             name_of_biggest_animal = Some(name);
//!         }
//!         Kingdom::Animal(..) | Kingdom::Plant(..) => ()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! match name_of_biggest_animal {
//!     Some(name) => println!("the biggest animal is {name}"),
//!     None => println!("there are no animals :("),
//! }
//! ```

/// A marker trait which represents "panic safe" types in Rust.
///
/// This trait is implemented by default for many types and behaves similarly in
/// terms of inference of implementation to the [`Send`] and [`Sync`] traits. The
/// purpose of this trait is to encode what types are safe to cross a [`catch_unwind`]
/// boundary with no fear of unwind safety.
///
/// [`catch_unwind`]: ../../std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html
///
/// ## What is unwind safety?
///
/// In Rust a function can "return" early if it either panics or calls a
/// function which transitively panics. This sort of control flow is not always
/// anticipated, and has the possibility of causing subtle bugs through a
/// combination of two critical components:
///
/// 1. A data structure is in a temporarily invalid state when the thread
///    panics.
/// 2. This broken invariant is then later observed.
///
/// Typically in Rust, it is difficult to perform step (2) because catching a
/// panic involves either spawning a thread (which in turns makes it difficult
/// to later witness broken invariants) or using the `catch_unwind` function in this
/// module. Additionally, even if an invariant is witnessed, it typically isn't a
/// problem in Rust because there are no uninitialized values (like in C or C++).
///
/// It is possible, however, for **logical** invariants to be broken in Rust,
/// which can end up causing behavioral bugs. Another key aspect of unwind safety
/// in Rust is that, in the absence of `unsafe` code, a panic cannot lead to
/// memory unsafety.
///
/// That was a bit of a whirlwind tour of unwind safety, but for more information
/// about unwind safety and how it applies to Rust, see an [associated RFC][rfc].
///
/// [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md
///
/// ## What is `UnwindSafe`?
///
/// Now that we've got an idea of what unwind safety is in Rust, it's also
/// important to understand what this trait represents. As mentioned above, one
/// way to witness broken invariants is through the `catch_unwind` function in this
/// module as it allows catching a panic and then re-using the environment of
/// the closure.
///
/// Simply put, a type `T` implements `UnwindSafe` if it cannot easily allow
/// witnessing a broken invariant through the use of `catch_unwind` (catching a
/// panic). This trait is an auto trait, so it is automatically implemented for
/// many types, and it is also structurally composed (e.g., a struct is unwind
/// safe if all of its components are unwind safe).
///
/// Note, however, that this is not an unsafe trait, so there is not a succinct
/// contract that this trait is providing. Instead it is intended as more of a
/// "speed bump" to alert users of `catch_unwind` that broken invariants may be
/// witnessed and may need to be accounted for.
///
/// ## Who implements `UnwindSafe`?
///
/// Types such as `&mut T` and `&RefCell<T>` are examples which are **not**
/// unwind safe. The general idea is that any mutable state which can be shared
/// across `catch_unwind` is not unwind safe by default. This is because it is very
/// easy to witness a broken invariant outside of `catch_unwind` as the data is
/// simply accessed as usual.
///
/// Types like `&Mutex<T>`, however, are unwind safe because they implement
/// poisoning by default. They still allow witnessing a broken invariant, but
/// they already provide their own "speed bumps" to do so.
///
/// ## When should `UnwindSafe` be used?
///
/// It is not intended that most types or functions need to worry about this trait.
/// It is only used as a bound on the `catch_unwind` function and as mentioned
/// above, the lack of `unsafe` means it is mostly an advisory. The
/// [`AssertUnwindSafe`] wrapper struct can be used to force this trait to be
/// implemented for any closed over variables passed to `catch_unwind`.

/// A simple wrapper around a type to assert that it is unwind safe.

/// When using [`catch_unwind`] it may be the case that some of the closed over

/// compiler will generate a warning indicating that it is not unwind safe. It
/// might not be the case, however, that this is actually a problem due to the
/// specific usage of [`catch_unwind`] if unwind safety is specifically taken into
/// account. This wrapper struct is useful for a quick and lightweight
/// annotation that a variable is indeed unwind safe.
///
/// [`catch_unwind`]: ../../std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// One way to use `AssertUnwindSafe` is to assert that the entire closure
/// itself is unwind safe, bypassing all checks for all variables:
///
/// ```
/// use std::panic::{self, AssertUnwindSafe};
///
/// let mut variable = 4;
///
/// // This code will not compile because the closure captures `&mut variable`
/// // which is not considered unwind safe by default.
///
/// // panic::catch_unwind(|| {
/// //     variable += 3;
/// // });
///
/// // This, however, will compile due to the `AssertUnwindSafe` wrapper
/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
///     variable += 3;
/// }));
/// // ...
/// ```
///
/// Wrapping the entire closure amounts to a blanket assertion that all captured
/// variables are unwind safe. This has the downside that if new captures are
/// added in the future, they will also be considered unwind safe. Therefore,
/// you may prefer to just wrap individual captures, as shown below. This is
/// more annotation, but it ensures that if a new capture is added which is not
/// unwind safe, you will get a compilation error at that time, which will
/// allow you to consider whether that new capture in fact represent a bug or
/// not.
///
/// ```
/// use std::panic::{self, AssertUnwindSafe};
///
/// let mut variable = 4;
/// let other_capture = 3;
///
/// let result = {
///     let mut wrapper = AssertUnwindSafe(&mut variable);

//! # { loop {} }
//! ```
//!
//! This definition allows for panicking with any general message, but it does not
//! allow for failing with a `Box<Any>` value. (`PanicInfo` just contains a `&(dyn Any + Send)`,
//! for which we fill in a dummy value in `PanicInfo::internal_constructor`.)
//! The reason for this is that libcore is not allowed to allocate.
//!
//! This module contains a few other panicking functions, but these are just the
//! necessary lang items for the compiler. All panics are funneled through this
//! one function. The actual symbol is declared through the `#[panic_handler]` attribute.

pub mod pin {
//! Types that pin data to its location in memory.
//!
//! It is sometimes useful to have objects that are guaranteed not to move,
//! in the sense that their placement in memory does not change, and can thus be relied upon.
//! A prime example of such a scenario would be building self-referential structs,
//! as moving an object with pointers to itself will invalidate them, which could cause undefined
//! behavior.
//!
//! At a high level, a <code>[Pin]\<P></code> ensures that the pointee of any pointer type
//! `P` has a stable location in memory, meaning it cannot be moved elsewhere
//! and its memory cannot be deallocated until it gets dropped. We say that the
//! pointee is "pinned". Things get more subtle when discussing types that
//! combine pinned with non-pinned data; [see below](#projections-and-structural-pinning)
//! for more details.
//!
//! By default, all types in Rust are movable. Rust allows passing all types by-value,
//! and common smart-pointer types such as <code>[Box]\<T></code> and <code>[&mut] T</code> allow
//! replacing and moving the values they contain: you can move out of a <code>[Box]\<T></code>,
//! or you can use [`mem::swap`]. <code>[Pin]\<P></code> wraps a pointer type `P`, so
//! <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code> functions much like a regular <code>[Box]\<T></code>:
//! when a <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code> gets dropped, so do its contents, and the memory gets
//! deallocated. Similarly, <code>[Pin]<[&mut] T></code> is a lot like <code>[&mut] T</code>.
//! However, <code>[Pin]\<P></code> does not let clients actually obtain a <code>[Box]\<T></code>
//! or <code>[&mut] T</code> to pinned data, which implies that you cannot use operations such
//! as [`mem::swap`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::pin::Pin;
//! fn swap_pins<T>(x: Pin<&mut T>, y: Pin<&mut T>) {
//!     // `mem::swap` needs `&mut T`, but we cannot get it.
//!     // We are stuck, we cannot swap the contents of these references.
//!     // We could use `Pin::get_unchecked_mut`, but that is unsafe for a reason:
//!     // we are not allowed to use it for moving things out of the `Pin`.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It is worth reiterating that <code>[Pin]\<P></code> does *not* change the fact that a Rust
//! compiler considers all types movable. [`mem::swap`] remains callable for any `T`. Instead,
//! <code>[Pin]\<P></code> prevents certain *values* (pointed to by pointers wrapped in
//! <code>[Pin]\<P></code>) from being moved by making it impossible to call methods that require
//! <code>[&mut] T</code> on them (like [`mem::swap`]).
//!
//! <code>[Pin]\<P></code> can be used to wrap any pointer type `P`, and as such it interacts with
//! [`Deref`] and [`DerefMut`]. A <code>[Pin]\<P></code> where <code>P: [Deref]</code> should be
//! considered as a "`P`-style pointer" to a pinned <code>P::[Target]</code> – so, a
//! <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code> is an owned pointer to a pinned `T`, and a
//! <code>[Pin]<[Rc]\<T>></code> is a reference-counted pointer to a pinned `T`.
//! For correctness, <code>[Pin]\<P></code> relies on the implementations of [`Deref`] and
//! [`DerefMut`] not to move out of their `self` parameter, and only ever to
//! return a pointer to pinned data when they are called on a pinned pointer.
//!
//! # `Unpin`
//!
//! Many types are always freely movable, even when pinned, because they do not
//! rely on having a stable address. This includes all the basic types (like
//! [`bool`], [`i32`], and references) as well as types consisting solely of these
//! types. Types that do not care about pinning implement the [`Unpin`]
//! auto-trait, which cancels the effect of <code>[Pin]\<P></code>. For <code>T: [Unpin]</code>,
//! <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code> and <code>[Box]\<T></code> function identically, as do
//! <code>[Pin]<[&mut] T></code> and <code>[&mut] T</code>.
//!
//! Note that pinning and [`Unpin`] only affect the pointed-to type <code>P::[Target]</code>,
//! not the pointer type `P` itself that got wrapped in <code>[Pin]\<P></code>. For example,
//! whether or not <code>[Box]\<T></code> is [`Unpin`] has no effect on the behavior of
//! <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code> (here, `T` is the pointed-to type).
//!
//! # Example: self-referential struct
//!
//! Before we go into more details to explain the guarantees and choices
//! associated with <code>[Pin]\<P></code>, we discuss some examples for how it might be used.
//! Feel free to [skip to where the theoretical discussion continues](#drop-guarantee).
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::pin::Pin;
//! use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
//! use std::ptr::NonNull;
//!
//! // This is a self-referential struct because the slice field points to the data field.
//! // We cannot inform the compiler about that with a normal reference,
//! // as this pattern cannot be described with the usual borrowing rules.
//! // Instead we use a raw pointer, though one which is known not to be null,
//! // as we know it's pointing at the string.
//! struct Unmovable {
//!     data: String,
//!     slice: NonNull<String>,
//!     _pin: PhantomPinned,
//! }
//!
//! impl Unmovable {
//!     // To ensure the data doesn't move when the function returns,
//!     // we place it in the heap where it will stay for the lifetime of the object,
//!     // and the only way to access it would be through a pointer to it.
//!     fn new(data: String) -> Pin<Box<Self>> {
//!         let res = Unmovable {
//!             data,
//!             // we only create the pointer once the data is in place
//!             // otherwise it will have already moved before we even started
//!             slice: NonNull::dangling(),
//!             _pin: PhantomPinned,
//!         };
//!         let mut boxed = Box::pin(res);
//!
//!         let slice = NonNull::from(&boxed.data);
//!         // we know this is safe because modifying a field doesn't move the whole struct
//!         unsafe {
//!             let mut_ref: Pin<&mut Self> = Pin::as_mut(&mut boxed);
//!             Pin::get_unchecked_mut(mut_ref).slice = slice;
//!         }
//!         boxed
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let unmoved = Unmovable::new("hello".to_string());
//! // The pointer should point to the correct location,
//! // so long as the struct hasn't moved.
//! // Meanwhile, we are free to move the pointer around.
//! # #[allow(unused_mut)]
//! let mut still_unmoved = unmoved;
//! assert_eq!(still_unmoved.slice, NonNull::from(&still_unmoved.data));
//!
//! // Since our type doesn't implement Unpin, this will fail to compile:
//! // let mut new_unmoved = Unmovable::new("world".to_string());
//! // std::mem::swap(&mut *still_unmoved, &mut *new_unmoved);
//! ```
//!
//! # Example: intrusive doubly-linked list
//!
//! In an intrusive doubly-linked list, the collection does not actually allocate
//! the memory for the elements itself. Allocation is controlled by the clients,
//! and elements can live on a stack frame that lives shorter than the collection does.
//!
//! To make this work, every element has pointers to its predecessor and successor in
//! the list. Elements can only be added when they are pinned, because moving the elements
//! around would invalidate the pointers. Moreover, the [`Drop`][Drop] implementation of a linked
//! list element will patch the pointers of its predecessor and successor to remove itself
//! from the list.
//!
//! Crucially, we have to be able to rely on [`drop`] being called. If an element
//! could be deallocated or otherwise invalidated without calling [`drop`], the pointers into it
//! from its neighboring elements would become invalid, which would break the data structure.
//!
//! Therefore, pinning also comes with a [`drop`]-related guarantee.
//!
//! # `Drop` guarantee
//!
//! The purpose of pinning is to be able to rely on the placement of some data in memory.
//! To make this work, not just moving the data is restricted; deallocating, repurposing, or
//! otherwise invalidating the memory used to store the data is restricted, too.
//! Concretely, for pinned data you have to maintain the invariant
//! that *its memory will not get invalidated or repurposed from the moment it gets pinned until
//! when [`drop`] is called*.  Only once [`drop`] returns or panics, the memory may be reused.
//!
//! Memory can be "invalidated" by deallocation, but also by
//! replacing a <code>[Some]\(v)</code> by [`None`], or calling [`Vec::set_len`] to "kill" some
//! elements off of a vector. It can be repurposed by using [`ptr::write`] to overwrite it without
//! calling the destructor first. None of this is allowed for pinned data without calling [`drop`].
//!
//! This is exactly the kind of guarantee that the intrusive linked list from the previous
//! section needs to function correctly.
//!
//! Notice that this guarantee does *not* mean that memory does not leak! It is still
//! completely okay to not ever call [`drop`] on a pinned element (e.g., you can still
//! call [`mem::forget`] on a <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code>). In the example of the doubly-linked
//! list, that element would just stay in the list. However you must not free or reuse the storage
//! *without calling [`drop`]*.
//!
//! # `Drop` implementation
//!
//! If your type uses pinning (such as the two examples above), you have to be careful
//! when implementing [`Drop`][Drop]. The [`drop`] function takes <code>[&mut] self</code>, but this
//! is called *even if your type was previously pinned*! It is as if the
//! compiler automatically called [`Pin::get_unchecked_mut`].
//!
//! This can never cause a problem in safe code because implementing a type that
//! relies on pinning requires unsafe code, but be aware that deciding to make
//! use of pinning in your type (for example by implementing some operation on
//! <code>[Pin]<[&]Self></code> or <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Self></code>) has consequences for your
//! [`Drop`][Drop] implementation as well: if an element of your type could have been pinned,
//! you must treat [`Drop`][Drop] as implicitly taking <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Self></code>.
//!
//! For example, you could implement [`Drop`][Drop] as follows:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::pin::Pin;
//! # struct Type { }
//! impl Drop for Type {
//!     fn drop(&mut self) {
//!         // `new_unchecked` is okay because we know this value is never used
//!         // again after being dropped.
//!         inner_drop(unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(self)});
//!         fn inner_drop(this: Pin<&mut Type>) {
//!             // Actual drop code goes here.
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The function `inner_drop` has the type that [`drop`] *should* have, so this makes sure that
//! you do not accidentally use `self`/`this` in a way that is in conflict with pinning.
//!
//! Moreover, if your type is `#[repr(packed)]`, the compiler will automatically
//! move fields around to be able to drop them. It might even do
//! that for fields that happen to be sufficiently aligned. As a consequence, you cannot use
//! pinning with a `#[repr(packed)]` type.
//!
//! # Projections and Structural Pinning
//!
//! When working with pinned structs, the question arises how one can access the
//! fields of that struct in a method that takes just <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Struct></code>.
//! The usual approach is to write helper methods (so called *projections*)
//! that turn <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Struct></code> into a reference to the field, but what type should
//! that reference have? Is it <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Field></code> or <code>[&mut] Field</code>?
//! The same question arises with the fields of an `enum`, and also when considering
//! container/wrapper types such as <code>[Vec]\<T></code>, <code>[Box]\<T></code>,
//! or <code>[RefCell]\<T></code>. (This question applies to both mutable and shared references,
//! we just use the more common case of mutable references here for illustration.)
//!
//! It turns out that it is actually up to the author of the data structure to decide whether
//! the pinned projection for a particular field turns <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Struct></code>
//! into <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Field></code> or <code>[&mut] Field</code>. There are some
//! constraints though, and the most important constraint is *consistency*:
//! every field can be *either* projected to a pinned reference, *or* have
//! pinning removed as part of the projection. If both are done for the same field,
//! that will likely be unsound!
//!
//! As the author of a data structure you get to decide for each field whether pinning
//! "propagates" to this field or not. Pinning that propagates is also called "structural",
//! because it follows the structure of the type.
//! In the following subsections, we describe the considerations that have to be made
//! for either choice.
//!
//! ## Pinning *is not* structural for `field`
//!
//! It may seem counter-intuitive that the field of a pinned struct might not be pinned,
//! but that is actually the easiest choice: if a <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Field></code> is never created,
//! nothing can go wrong! So, if you decide that some field does not have structural pinning,
//! all you have to ensure is that you never create a pinned reference to that field.
//!
//! Fields without structural pinning may have a projection method that turns
//! <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Struct></code> into <code>[&mut] Field</code>:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::pin::Pin;
//! # type Field = i32;
//! # struct Struct { field: Field }
//! impl Struct {
//!     fn pin_get_field(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> &mut Field {
//!         // This is okay because `field` is never considered pinned.
//!         unsafe { &mut self.get_unchecked_mut().field }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You may also <code>impl [Unpin] for Struct</code> *even if* the type of `field`
//! is not [`Unpin`]. What that type thinks about pinning is not relevant
//! when no <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Field></code> is ever created.
//!
//! ## Pinning *is* structural for `field`
//!
//! The other option is to decide that pinning is "structural" for `field`,
//! meaning that if the struct is pinned then so is the field.
//!
//! This allows writing a projection that creates a <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Field></code>, thus
//! witnessing that the field is pinned:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::pin::Pin;
//! # type Field = i32;
//! # struct Struct { field: Field }
//! impl Struct {
//!     fn pin_get_field(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> Pin<&mut Field> {
//!         // This is okay because `field` is pinned when `self` is.
//!         unsafe { self.map_unchecked_mut(|s| &mut s.field) }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! However, structural pinning comes with a few extra requirements:
//!
//! 1.  The struct must only be [`Unpin`] if all the structural fields are
//!     [`Unpin`]. This is the default, but [`Unpin`] is a safe trait, so as the author of
//!     the struct it is your responsibility *not* to add something like
//!     <code>impl\<T> [Unpin] for Struct\<T></code>. (Notice that adding a projection operation
//!     requires unsafe code, so the fact that [`Unpin`] is a safe trait does not break
//!     the principle that you only have to worry about any of this if you use [`unsafe`].)
//! 2.  The destructor of the struct must not move structural fields out of its argument. This
//!     is the exact point that was raised in the [previous section][drop-impl]: [`drop`] takes
//!     <code>[&mut] self</code>, but the struct (and hence its fields) might have been pinned
//!     before. You have to guarantee that you do not move a field inside your [`Drop`][Drop]
//!     implementation. In particular, as explained previously, this means that your struct
//!     must *not* be `#[repr(packed)]`.
//!     See that section for how to write [`drop`] in a way that the compiler can help you
//!     not accidentally break pinning.
//! 3.  You must make sure that you uphold the [`Drop` guarantee][drop-guarantee]:
//!     once your struct is pinned, the memory that contains the
//!     content is not overwritten or deallocated without calling the content's destructors.
//!     This can be tricky, as witnessed by <code>[VecDeque]\<T></code>: the destructor of
//!     <code>[VecDeque]\<T></code> can fail to call [`drop`] on all elements if one of the
//!     destructors panics. This violates the [`Drop`][Drop] guarantee, because it can lead to
//!     elements being deallocated without their destructor being called.
//!     (<code>[VecDeque]\<T></code> has no pinning projections, so this
//!     does not cause unsoundness.)
//! 4.  You must not offer any other operations that could lead to data being moved out of
//!     the structural fields when your type is pinned. For example, if the struct contains an
//!     <code>[Option]\<T></code> and there is a [`take`][Option::take]-like operation with type
//!     <code>fn([Pin]<[&mut] Struct\<T>>) -> [Option]\<T></code>,
//!     that operation can be used to move a `T` out of a pinned `Struct<T>` – which means
//!     pinning cannot be structural for the field holding this data.
//!
//!     For a more complex example of moving data out of a pinned type,
//!     imagine if <code>[RefCell]\<T></code> had a method
//!     <code>fn get_pin_mut(self: [Pin]<[&mut] Self>) -> [Pin]<[&mut] T></code>.
//!     Then we could do the following:
//!     ```compile_fail
//!     fn exploit_ref_cell<T>(rc: Pin<&mut RefCell<T>>) {
//!         { let p = rc.as_mut().get_pin_mut(); } // Here we get pinned access to the `T`.
//!         let rc_shr: &RefCell<T> = rc.into_ref().get_ref();
//!         let b = rc_shr.borrow_mut();
//!         let content = &mut *b; // And here we have `&mut T` to the same data.
//!     }
//!     ```
//!     This is catastrophic, it means we can first pin the content of the
//!     <code>[RefCell]\<T></code> (using <code>[RefCell]::get_pin_mut</code>) and then move that
//!     content using the mutable reference we got later.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! For a type like <code>[Vec]\<T></code>, both possibilities (structural pinning or not) make
//! sense. A <code>[Vec]\<T></code> with structural pinning could have `get_pin`/`get_pin_mut`
//! methods to get pinned references to elements. However, it could *not* allow calling
//! [`pop`][Vec::pop] on a pinned <code>[Vec]\<T></code> because that would move the (structurally
//! pinned) contents! Nor could it allow [`push`][Vec::push], which might reallocate and thus also
//! move the contents.
//!
//! A <code>[Vec]\<T></code> without structural pinning could
//! <code>impl\<T> [Unpin] for [Vec]\<T></code>, because the contents are never pinned
//! and the <code>[Vec]\<T></code> itself is fine with being moved as well.
//! At that point pinning just has no effect on the vector at all.
//!
//! In the standard library, pointer types generally do not have structural pinning,
//! and thus they do not offer pinning projections. This is why <code>[Box]\<T>: [Unpin]</code>
//! holds for all `T`. It makes sense to do this for pointer types, because moving the
//! <code>[Box]\<T></code> does not actually move the `T`: the <code>[Box]\<T></code> can be freely
//! movable (aka [`Unpin`]) even if the `T` is not. In fact, even <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code> and
//! <code>[Pin]<[&mut] T></code> are always [`Unpin`] themselves, for the same reason:
//! their contents (the `T`) are pinned, but the pointers themselves can be moved without moving
//! the pinned data. For both <code>[Box]\<T></code> and <code>[Pin]<[Box]\<T>></code>,
//! whether the content is pinned is entirely independent of whether the
//! pointer is pinned, meaning pinning is *not* structural.
//!
//! When implementing a [`Future`] combinator, you will usually need structural pinning
//! for the nested futures, as you need to get pinned references to them to call [`poll`].
//! But if your combinator contains any other data that does not need to be pinned,
//! you can make those fields not structural and hence freely access them with a
//! mutable reference even when you just have <code>[Pin]<[&mut] Self></code> (such as in your own
//! [`poll`] implementation).

//!

//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Pattern matching on [`Result`]s is clear and straightforward for
//! simple cases, but [`Result`] comes with some convenience methods
//! that make working with it more succinct.
//!
//! ```
//! let good_result: Result<i32, i32> = Ok(10);
//! let bad_result: Result<i32, i32> = Err(10);
//!
//! // The `is_ok` and `is_err` methods do what they say.
//! assert!(good_result.is_ok() && !good_result.is_err());
//! assert!(bad_result.is_err() && !bad_result.is_ok());
//!
//! // `map` consumes the `Result` and produces another.
//! let good_result: Result<i32, i32> = good_result.map(|i| i + 1);
//! let bad_result: Result<i32, i32> = bad_result.map(|i| i - 1);
//!
//! // Use `and_then` to continue the computation.
//! let good_result: Result<bool, i32> = good_result.and_then(|i| Ok(i == 11));
//!
//! // Use `or_else` to handle the error.
//! let bad_result: Result<i32, i32> = bad_result.or_else(|i| Ok(i + 20));
//!
//! // Consume the result and return the contents with `unwrap`.
//! let final_awesome_result = good_result.unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Results must be used
//!
//! A common problem with using return values to indicate errors is
//! that it is easy to ignore the return value, thus failing to handle
//! the error. [`Result`] is annotated with the `#[must_use]` attribute,
//! which will cause the compiler to issue a warning when a Result
//! value is ignored. This makes [`Result`] especially useful with
//! functions that may encounter errors but don't otherwise return a
//! useful value.
//!
//! Consider the [`write_all`] method defined for I/O types
//! by the [`Write`] trait:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::io;
//!
//! trait Write {
//!     fn write_all(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<(), io::Error>;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! *Note: The actual definition of [`Write`] uses [`io::Result`], which
//! is just a synonym for <code>[Result]<T, [io::Error]></code>.*
//!
//! This method doesn't produce a value, but the write may
//! fail. It's crucial to handle the error case, and *not* write
//! something like this:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # #![allow(unused_must_use)] // \o/
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//!
//! let mut file = File::create("valuable_data.txt").unwrap();
//! // If `write_all` errors, then we'll never know, because the return
//! // value is ignored.
//! file.write_all(b"important message");
//! ```
//!
//! If you *do* write that in Rust, the compiler will give you a
//! warning (by default, controlled by the `unused_must_use` lint).
//!
//! You might instead, if you don't want to handle the error, simply
//! assert success with [`expect`]. This will panic if the
//! write fails, providing a marginally useful message indicating why:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//!
//! let mut file = File::create("valuable_data.txt").unwrap();
//! file.write_all(b"important message").expect("failed to write message");
//! ```
//!
//! You might also simply assert success:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use std::fs::File;
//! # use std::io::prelude::*;
//! # let mut file = File::create("valuable_data.txt").unwrap();
//! assert!(file.write_all(b"important message").is_ok());
//! ```
//!
//! Or propagate the error up the call stack with [`?`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::fs::File;
//! # use std::io::prelude::*;
//! # use std::io;
//! # #[allow(dead_code)]
//! fn write_message() -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let mut file = File::create("valuable_data.txt")?;
//!     file.write_all(b"important message")?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # The question mark operator, `?`
//!
//! When writing code that calls many functions that return the
//! [`Result`] type, the error handling can be tedious. The question mark
//! operator, [`?`], hides some of the boilerplate of propagating errors
//! up the call stack.
//!
//! It replaces this:
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(dead_code)]
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io;
//!
//! struct Info {
//!     name: String,
//!     age: i32,
//!     rating: i32,
//! }
//!
//! fn write_info(info: &Info) -> io::Result<()> {
//!     // Early return on error
//!     let mut file = match File::create("my_best_friends.txt") {
//!            Err(e) => return Err(e),
//!            Ok(f) => f,
//!     };
//!     if let Err(e) = file.write_all(format!("name: {}\n", info.name).as_bytes()) {
//!         return Err(e)
//!     }
//!     if let Err(e) = file.write_all(format!("age: {}\n", info.age).as_bytes()) {
//!         return Err(e)
//!     }
//!     if let Err(e) = file.write_all(format!("rating: {}\n", info.rating).as_bytes()) {
//!         return Err(e)
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! With this:
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(dead_code)]
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io;
//!
//! struct Info {
//!     name: String,
//!     age: i32,
//!     rating: i32,
//! }
//!
//! fn write_info(info: &Info) -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let mut file = File::create("my_best_friends.txt")?;
//!     // Early return on error
//!     file.write_all(format!("name: {}\n", info.name).as_bytes())?;
//!     file.write_all(format!("age: {}\n", info.age).as_bytes())?;
//!     file.write_all(format!("rating: {}\n", info.rating).as_bytes())?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! *It's much nicer!*
//!
//! Ending the expression with [`?`] will result in the unwrapped
//! success ([`Ok`]) value, unless the result is [`Err`], in which case
//! [`Err`] is returned early from the enclosing function.
//!
//! [`?`] can only be used in functions that return [`Result`] because of the
//! early return of [`Err`] that it provides.

//! # Method overview
//!
//! In addition to working with pattern matching, [`Result`] provides a
//! wide variety of different methods.
//!
//! ## Querying the variant
//!
//! The [`is_ok`] and [`is_err`] methods return [`true`] if the [`Result`]
//! is [`Ok`] or [`Err`], respectively.
//!
//! [`is_err`]: Result::is_err
//! [`is_ok`]: Result::is_ok
//!
//! ## Adapters for working with references
//!
//! * [`as_ref`] converts from `&Result<T, E>` to `Result<&T, &E>`
//! * [`as_mut`] converts from `&mut Result<T, E>` to `Result<&mut T, &mut E>`
//! * [`as_deref`] converts from `&Result<T, E>` to `Result<&T::Target, &E>`
//! * [`as_deref_mut`] converts from `&mut Result<T, E>` to
//!   `Result<&mut T::Target, &mut E>`
//!
//! [`as_deref`]: Result::as_deref
//! [`as_deref_mut`]: Result::as_deref_mut
//! [`as_mut`]: Result::as_mut
//! [`as_ref`]: Result::as_ref
//!
//! ## Extracting contained values
//!
//! These methods extract the contained value in a [`Result<T, E>`] when it
//! is the [`Ok`] variant. If the [`Result`] is [`Err`]:
//!
//! * [`expect`] panics with a provided custom message
//! * [`unwrap`] panics with a generic message
//! * [`unwrap_or`] returns the provided default value
//! * [`unwrap_or_default`] returns the default value of the type `T`
//!   (which must implement the [`Default`] trait)
//! * [`unwrap_or_else`] returns the result of evaluating the provided
//!   function
//!
//! The panicking methods [`expect`] and [`unwrap`] require `E` to
//! implement the [`Debug`] trait.
//!
//! [`Debug`]: crate::fmt::Debug
//! [`expect`]: Result::expect
//! [`unwrap`]: Result::unwrap
//! [`unwrap_or`]: Result::unwrap_or
//! [`unwrap_or_default`]: Result::unwrap_or_default
//! [`unwrap_or_else`]: Result::unwrap_or_else
//!
//! These methods extract the contained value in a [`Result<T, E>`] when it
//! is the [`Err`] variant. They require `T` to implement the [`Debug`]
//! trait. If the [`Result`] is [`Ok`]:
//!
//! * [`expect_err`] panics with a provided custom message
//! * [`unwrap_err`] panics with a generic message
//!
//! [`Debug`]: crate::fmt::Debug
//! [`expect_err`]: Result::expect_err
//! [`unwrap_err`]: Result::unwrap_err
//!
//! ## Transforming contained values
//!
//! These methods transform [`Result`] to [`Option`]:
//!
//! * [`err`][Result::err] transforms [`Result<T, E>`] into [`Option<E>`],
//!   mapping [`Err(e)`] to [`Some(e)`] and [`Ok(v)`] to [`None`]
//! * [`ok`][Result::ok] transforms [`Result<T, E>`] into [`Option<T>`],
//!   mapping [`Ok(v)`] to [`Some(v)`] and [`Err(e)`] to [`None`]
//! * [`transpose`] transposes a [`Result`] of an [`Option`] into an
//!   [`Option`] of a [`Result`]
//!
// Do NOT add link reference definitions for `err` or `ok`, because they
// will generate numerous incorrect URLs for `Err` and `Ok` elsewhere, due
// to case folding.
//!
//! [`Err(e)`]: Err
//! [`Ok(v)`]: Ok
//! [`Some(e)`]: Option::Some
//! [`Some(v)`]: Option::Some
//! [`transpose`]: Result::transpose
//!
//! This method transforms the contained value of the [`Ok`] variant:
//!
//! * [`map`] transforms [`Result<T, E>`] into [`Result<U, E>`] by applying
//!   the provided function to the contained value of [`Ok`] and leaving
//!   [`Err`] values unchanged
//!
//! [`map`]: Result::map
//!
//! This method transforms the contained value of the [`Err`] variant:
//!
//! * [`map_err`] transforms [`Result<T, E>`] into [`Result<T, F>`] by
//!   applying the provided function to the contained value of [`Err`] and
//!   leaving [`Ok`] values unchanged
//!
//! [`map_err`]: Result::map_err
//!
//! These methods transform a [`Result<T, E>`] into a value of a possibly
//! different type `U`:
//!
//! * [`map_or`] applies the provided function to the contained value of
//!   [`Ok`], or returns the provided default value if the [`Result`] is
//!   [`Err`]
//! * [`map_or_else`] applies the provided function to the contained value
//!   of [`Ok`], or applies the provided default fallback function to the
//!   contained value of [`Err`]
//!
//! [`map_or`]: Result::map_or
//! [`map_or_else`]: Result::map_or_else
//!
//! ## Boolean operators
//!
//! These methods treat the [`Result`] as a boolean value, where [`Ok`]
//! acts like [`true`] and [`Err`] acts like [`false`]. There are two
//! categories of these methods: ones that take a [`Result`] as input, and
//! ones that take a function as input (to be lazily evaluated).
//!
//! The [`and`] and [`or`] methods take another [`Result`] as input, and
//! produce a [`Result`] as output. The [`and`] method can produce a
//! [`Result<U, E>`] value having a different inner type `U` than
//! [`Result<T, E>`]. The [`or`] method can produce a [`Result<T, F>`]
//! value having a different error type `F` than [`Result<T, E>`].
//!
//! | method  | self     | input     | output   |
//! |---------|----------|-----------|----------|
//! | [`and`] | `Err(e)` | (ignored) | `Err(e)` |
//! | [`and`] | `Ok(x)`  | `Err(d)`  | `Err(d)` |
//! | [`and`] | `Ok(x)`  | `Ok(y)`   | `Ok(y)`  |
//! | [`or`]  | `Err(e)` | `Err(d)`  | `Err(d)` |
//! | [`or`]  | `Err(e)` | `Ok(y)`   | `Ok(y)`  |
//! | [`or`]  | `Ok(x)`  | (ignored) | `Ok(x)`  |
//!
//! [`and`]: Result::and
//! [`or`]: Result::or
//!
//! The [`and_then`] and [`or_else`] methods take a function as input, and
//! only evaluate the function when they need to produce a new value. The
//! [`and_then`] method can produce a [`Result<U, E>`] value having a
//! different inner type `U` than [`Result<T, E>`]. The [`or_else`] method
//! can produce a [`Result<T, F>`] value having a different error type `F`
//! than [`Result<T, E>`].
//!
//! | method       | self     | function input | function result | output   |
//! |--------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
//! | [`and_then`] | `Err(e)` | (not provided) | (not evaluated) | `Err(e)` |
//! | [`and_then`] | `Ok(x)`  | `x`            | `Err(d)`        | `Err(d)` |
//! | [`and_then`] | `Ok(x)`  | `x`            | `Ok(y)`         | `Ok(y)`  |
//! | [`or_else`]  | `Err(e)` | `e`            | `Err(d)`        | `Err(d)` |
//! | [`or_else`]  | `Err(e)` | `e`            | `Ok(y)`         | `Ok(y)`  |
//! | [`or_else`]  | `Ok(x)`  | (not provided) | (not evaluated) | `Ok(x)`  |
//!
//! [`and_then`]: Result::and_then
//! [`or_else`]: Result::or_else
//!
//! ## Comparison operators
//!
//! If `T` and `E` both implement [`PartialOrd`] then [`Result<T, E>`] will
//! derive its [`PartialOrd`] implementation.  With this order, an [`Ok`]
//! compares as less than any [`Err`], while two [`Ok`] or two [`Err`]
//! compare as their contained values would in `T` or `E` respectively.  If `T`
//! and `E` both also implement [`Ord`], then so does [`Result<T, E>`].
//!
//! ```
//! assert!(Ok(1) < Err(0));
//! let x: Result<i32, ()> = Ok(0);
//! let y = Ok(1);
//! assert!(x < y);
//! let x: Result<(), i32> = Err(0);
//! let y = Err(1);
//! assert!(x < y);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Iterating over `Result`
//!
//! A [`Result`] can be iterated over. This can be helpful if you need an
//! iterator that is conditionally empty. The iterator will either produce
//! a single value (when the [`Result`] is [`Ok`]), or produce no values
//! (when the [`Result`] is [`Err`]). For example, [`into_iter`] acts like
//! [`once(v)`] if the [`Result`] is [`Ok(v)`], and like [`empty()`] if the
//! [`Result`] is [`Err`].
//!
//! [`Ok(v)`]: Ok
//! [`empty()`]: crate::iter::empty
//! [`once(v)`]: crate::iter::once
//!
//! Iterators over [`Result<T, E>`] come in three types:
//!
//! * [`into_iter`] consumes the [`Result`] and produces the contained
//!   value
//! * [`iter`] produces an immutable reference of type `&T` to the
//!   contained value
//! * [`iter_mut`] produces a mutable reference of type `&mut T` to the
//!   contained value
//!
//! See [Iterating over `Option`] for examples of how this can be useful.
//!
//! [Iterating over `Option`]: crate::option#iterating-over-option
//! [`into_iter`]: Result::into_iter
//! [`iter`]: Result::iter
//! [`iter_mut`]: Result::iter_mut
//!
//! You might want to use an iterator chain to do multiple instances of an
//! operation that can fail, but would like to ignore failures while
//! continuing to process the successful results. In this example, we take
//! advantage of the iterable nature of [`Result`] to select only the
//! [`Ok`] values using [`flatten`][Iterator::flatten].
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::str::FromStr;
//! let mut results = vec![];
//! let mut errs = vec![];
//! let nums: Vec<_> = ["17", "not a number", "99", "-27", "768"]
//!    .into_iter()
//!    .map(u8::from_str)
//!    // Save clones of the raw `Result` values to inspect
//!    .inspect(|x| results.push(x.clone()))
//!    // Challenge: explain how this captures only the `Err` values
//!    .inspect(|x| errs.extend(x.clone().err()))
//!    .flatten()
//!    .collect();
//! assert_eq!(errs.len(), 3);
//! assert_eq!(nums, [17, 99]);
//! println!("results {results:?}");
//! println!("errs {errs:?}");
//! println!("nums {nums:?}");
//! ```
//!
//! ## Collecting into `Result`
//!
//! [`Result`] implements the [`FromIterator`][impl-FromIterator] trait,
//! which allows an iterator over [`Result`] values to be collected into a
//! [`Result`] of a collection of each contained value of the original
//! [`Result`] values, or [`Err`] if any of the elements was [`Err`].
//!
//! [impl-FromIterator]: Result#impl-FromIterator%3CResult%3CA%2C%20E%3E%3E-for-Result%3CV%2C%20E%3E
//!
//! ```
//! let v = [Ok(2), Ok(4), Err("err!"), Ok(8)];
//! let res: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = v.into_iter().collect();
//! assert_eq!(res, Err("err!"));
//! let v = [Ok(2), Ok(4), Ok(8)];
//! let res: Result<Vec<_>, &str> = v.into_iter().collect();
//! assert_eq!(res, Ok(vec![2, 4, 8]));
//! ```
//!
//! [`Result`] also implements the [`Product`][impl-Product] and
//! [`Sum`][impl-Sum] traits, allowing an iterator over [`Result`] values
//! to provide the [`product`][Iterator::product] and
//! [`sum`][Iterator::sum] methods.
//!
//! [impl-Product]: Result#impl-Product%3CResult%3CU%2C%20E%3E%3E-for-Result%3CT%2C%20E%3E
//! [impl-Sum]: Result#impl-Sum%3CResult%3CU%2C%20E%3E%3E-for-Result%3CT%2C%20E%3E
//!
//! ```
//! let v = [Err("error!"), Ok(1), Ok(2), Ok(3), Err("foo")];
//! let res: Result<i32, &str> = v.into_iter().sum();
//! assert_eq!(res, Err("error!"));
//! let v = [Ok(1), Ok(2), Ok(21)];
//! let res: Result<i32, &str> = v.into_iter().product();
//! assert_eq!(res, Ok(42));
//! ```

pub mod atomic {
//! Atomic types
//!
//! Atomic types provide primitive shared-memory communication between
//! threads, and are the building blocks of other concurrent
//! types.
//!
//! Rust atomics currently follow the same rules as [C++20 atomics][cpp], specifically `atomic_ref`.
//! Basically, creating a *shared reference* to one of the Rust atomic types corresponds to creating
//! an `atomic_ref` in C++; the `atomic_ref` is destroyed when the lifetime of the shared reference
//! ends. (A Rust atomic type that is exclusively owned or behind a mutable reference does *not*
//! correspond to an "atomic object" in C++, since it can be accessed via non-atomic operations.)
//!
//! This module defines atomic versions of a select number of primitive
//! types, including [`AtomicBool`], [`AtomicIsize`], [`AtomicUsize`],
//! [`AtomicI8`], [`AtomicU16`], etc.
//! Atomic types present operations that, when used correctly, synchronize
//! updates between threads.
//!
//! Each method takes an [`Ordering`] which represents the strength of
//! the memory barrier for that operation. These orderings are the
//! same as the [C++20 atomic orderings][1]. For more information see the [nomicon][2].
//!
//! [cpp]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic
//! [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order
//! [2]: ../../../nomicon/atomics.html
//!
//! Atomic variables are safe to share between threads (they implement [`Sync`])
//! but they do not themselves provide the mechanism for sharing and follow the
//! [threading model](../../../std/thread/index.html#the-threading-model) of Rust.
//! The most common way to share an atomic variable is to put it into an [`Arc`][arc] (an
//! atomically-reference-counted shared pointer).
//!
//! [arc]: ../../../std/sync/struct.Arc.html
//!
//! Atomic types may be stored in static variables, initialized using
//! the constant initializers like [`AtomicBool::new`]. Atomic statics
//! are often used for lazy global initialization.
//!
//! # Portability
//!
//! All atomic types in this module are guaranteed to be [lock-free] if they're
//! available. This means they don't internally acquire a global mutex. Atomic
//! types and operations are not guaranteed to be wait-free. This means that
//! operations like `fetch_or` may be implemented with a compare-and-swap loop.
//!
//! Atomic operations may be implemented at the instruction layer with
//! larger-size atomics. For example some platforms use 4-byte atomic
//! instructions to implement `AtomicI8`. Note that this emulation should not
//! have an impact on correctness of code, it's just something to be aware of.
//!
//! The atomic types in this module might not be available on all platforms. The
//! atomic types here are all widely available, however, and can generally be
//! relied upon existing. Some notable exceptions are:
//!
//! * PowerPC and MIPS platforms with 32-bit pointers do not have `AtomicU64` or
//!   `AtomicI64` types.
//! * ARM platforms like `armv5te` that aren't for Linux only provide `load`
//!   and `store` operations, and do not support Compare and Swap (CAS)
//!   operations, such as `swap`, `fetch_add`, etc. Additionally on Linux,
//!   these CAS operations are implemented via [operating system support], which
//!   may come with a performance penalty.
//! * ARM targets with `thumbv6m` only provide `load` and `store` operations,
//!   and do not support Compare and Swap (CAS) operations, such as `swap`,
//!   `fetch_add`, etc.
//!
//! [operating system support]: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/arm/kernel_user_helpers.txt
//!
//! Note that future platforms may be added that also do not have support for
//! some atomic operations. Maximally portable code will want to be careful
//! about which atomic types are used. `AtomicUsize` and `AtomicIsize` are
//! generally the most portable, but even then they're not available everywhere.
//! For reference, the `std` library requires `AtomicBool`s and pointer-sized atomics, although
//! `core` does not.
//!
//! The `#[cfg(target_has_atomic)]` attribute can be used to conditionally
//! compile based on the target's supported bit widths. It is a key-value
//! option set for each supported size, with values "8", "16", "32", "64",
//! "128", and "ptr" for pointer-sized atomics.
//!
//! [lock-free]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A simple spinlock:

/// A compiler memory fence.
///
/// `compiler_fence` does not emit any machine code, but restricts the kinds
/// of memory re-ordering the compiler is allowed to do. Specifically, depending on
/// the given [`Ordering`] semantics, the compiler may be disallowed from moving reads
/// or writes from before or after the call to the other side of the call to
/// `compiler_fence`. Note that it does **not** prevent the *hardware*
/// from doing such re-ordering. This is not a problem in a single-threaded,
/// execution context, but when other threads may modify memory at the same
/// time, stronger synchronization primitives such as [`fence`] are required.
///
/// The re-ordering prevented by the different ordering semantics are:
///
///  - with [`SeqCst`], no re-ordering of reads and writes across this point is allowed.
///  - with [`Release`], preceding reads and writes cannot be moved past subsequent writes.
///  - with [`Acquire`], subsequent reads and writes cannot be moved ahead of preceding reads.
///  - with [`AcqRel`], both of the above rules are enforced.
///
/// `compiler_fence` is generally only useful for preventing a thread from
/// racing *with itself*. That is, if a given thread is executing one piece
/// of code, and is then interrupted, and starts executing code elsewhere
/// (while still in the same thread, and conceptually still on the same
/// core). In traditional programs, this can only occur when a signal
/// handler is registered. In more low-level code, such situations can also
/// arise when handling interrupts, when implementing green threads with
/// pre-emption, etc. Curious readers are encouraged to read the Linux kernel's
/// discussion of [memory barriers].
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if `order` is [`Relaxed`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Without `compiler_fence`, the `assert_eq!` in following code
/// is *not* guaranteed to succeed, despite everything happening in a single thread.
/// To see why, remember that the compiler is free to swap the stores to
/// `IMPORTANT_VARIABLE` and `IS_READY` since they are both
/// `Ordering::Relaxed`. If it does, and the signal handler is invoked right
/// after `IS_READY` is updated, then the signal handler will see
/// `IS_READY=1`, but `IMPORTANT_VARIABLE=0`.
/// Using a `compiler_fence` remedies this situation.
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicUsize};
/// use std::sync::atomic::Ordering;
/// use std::sync::atomic::compiler_fence;
///
/// static IMPORTANT_VARIABLE: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
/// static IS_READY: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);
///
/// fn main() {
///     IMPORTANT_VARIABLE.store(42, Ordering::Relaxed);
///     // prevent earlier writes from being moved beyond this point
///     compiler_fence(Ordering::Release);
///     IS_READY.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);
/// }
///
/// fn signal_handler() {
///     if IS_READY.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
///         assert_eq!(IMPORTANT_VARIABLE.load(Ordering::Relaxed), 42);

/// `Exclusive` provides only _mutable_ access, also referred to as _exclusive_
/// access to the underlying value. It provides no _immutable_, or _shared_
/// access to the underlying value.
///
/// While this may seem not very useful, it allows `Exclusive` to _unconditionally_
/// implement [`Sync`]. Indeed, the safety requirements of `Sync` state that for `Exclusive`
/// to be `Sync`, it must be sound to _share_ across threads, that is, it must be sound
/// for `&Exclusive` to cross thread boundaries. By design, a `&Exclusive` has no API
/// whatsoever, making it useless, thus harmless, thus memory safe.
///
/// Certain constructs like [`Future`]s can only be used with _exclusive_ access,
/// and are often `Send` but not `Sync`, so `Exclusive` can be used as hint to the
/// rust compiler that something is `Sync` in practice.
///
/// ## Examples
/// Using a non-`Sync` future prevents the wrapping struct from being `Sync`
/// ```compile_fail
/// use core::cell::Cell;
///
/// async fn other() {}
/// fn assert_sync<T: Sync>(t: T) {}

///         other().await;
///         let value = cell_ref.get();
///     }
/// });

///
/// `Exclusive` ensures the struct is `Sync` without stripping the future of its
/// functionality.
/// ```

/// async fn other() {}
/// fn assert_sync<T: Sync>(t: T) {}

/// ## Parallels with a mutex
/// In some sense, `Exclusive` can be thought of as a _compile-time_ version of
/// a mutex, as the borrow-checker guarantees that only one `&mut` can exist
/// for any value. This is a parallel with the fact that
/// `&` and `&mut` references together can be thought of as a _compile-time_
/// version of a read-write lock.

pub mod hash {
//! Generic hashing support.
//!
//! This module provides a generic way to compute the [hash] of a value.
//! Hashes are most commonly used with [`HashMap`] and [`HashSet`].
//!
//! [hash]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function
//! [`HashMap`]: ../../std/collections/struct.HashMap.html
//! [`HashSet`]: ../../std/collections/struct.HashSet.html
//!
//! The simplest way to make a type hashable is to use `#[derive(Hash)]`:
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher;
//! use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
//!
//! #[derive(Hash)]
//! struct Person {
//!     id: u32,
//!     name: String,
//!     phone: u64,
//! }
//!
//! let person1 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Janet".to_string(),
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//! let person2 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Bob".to_string(),
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,
//! };
//!
//! assert!(calculate_hash(&person1) != calculate_hash(&person2));
//!
//! fn calculate_hash<T: Hash>(t: &T) -> u64 {
//!     let mut s = DefaultHasher::new();
//!     t.hash(&mut s);
//!     s.finish()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If you need more control over how a value is hashed, you need to implement
//! the [`Hash`] trait:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher;
//! use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
//!
//! struct Person {
//!     id: u32,
//!     # #[allow(dead_code)]
//!     name: String,
//!     phone: u64,
//! }
//!
//! impl Hash for Person {
//!     fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
//!         self.id.hash(state);
//!         self.phone.hash(state);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let person1 = Person {
//!     id: 5,
//!     name: "Janet".to_string(),
//!     phone: 555_666_7777,

//!
//! assert_eq!(calculate_hash(&person1), calculate_hash(&person2));
//!
//! fn calculate_hash<T: Hash>(t: &T) -> u64 {
//!     let mut s = DefaultHasher::new();
//!     t.hash(&mut s);

///
/// ```

///     name: String,
///     country: String,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you need more control over how a value is hashed, you can of course
/// implement the `Hash` trait yourself:
///
/// ```
/// use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
///
/// struct Person {
///     id: u32,
///     name: String,
///     phone: u64,
/// }
///
/// impl Hash for Person {
///     fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
///         self.id.hash(state);
///         self.phone.hash(state);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## `Hash` and `Eq`
///
/// When implementing both `Hash` and [`Eq`], it is important that the following
/// property holds:
///
/// ```text
/// k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
/// ```
///
/// In other words, if two keys are equal, their hashes must also be equal.
/// [`HashMap`] and [`HashSet`] both rely on this behavior.
///
/// Thankfully, you won't need to worry about upholding this property when
/// deriving both [`Eq`] and `Hash` with `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]`.
///
/// ## Prefix collisions
///
/// Implementations of `hash` should ensure that the data they
/// pass to the `Hasher` are prefix-free. That is,
/// unequal values should cause two different sequences of values to be written,
/// and neither of the two sequences should be a prefix of the other.
///
/// For example, the standard implementation of [`Hash` for `&str`][impl] passes an extra
/// `0xFF` byte to the `Hasher` so that the values `("ab", "c")` and `("a",
/// "bc")` hash differently.
///
/// ## Portability
///
/// Due to differences in endianness and type sizes, data fed by `Hash` to a `Hasher`
/// should not be considered portable across platforms. Additionally the data passed by most
/// standard library types should not be considered stable between compiler versions.
///
/// This means tests shouldn't probe hard-coded hash values or data fed to a `Hasher` and
/// instead should check consistency with `Eq`.
///
/// Serialization formats intended to be portable between platforms or compiler versions should
/// either avoid encoding hashes or only rely on `Hash` and `Hasher` implementations that
/// provide additional guarantees.

    /// ## If your `Hasher` works byte-wise

/// X 7 8 9 10 11 6 13 14 15 . 0 1 2 3 4 5
///               ^
/// after using another step (now 2 is in the temporary):
/// X 7 8 9 10 11 6 13 14 15 . 0 1 12 3 4 5
///               ^                 ^
/// after the third step (the steps wrap around, and 8 is in the temporary):
/// X 7 2 9 10 11 6 13 14 15 . 0 1 12 3 4 5
///     ^         ^                 ^
/// after 7 more steps, the round ends with the temporary 0 getting put in the X:
/// 0 7 2 9 4 11 6 13 8 15 . 10 1 12 3 14 5
/// ^   ^   ^    ^    ^       ^    ^    ^
/// ```
/// Fortunately, the number of skipped over elements between finalized elements is always equal, so
/// we can just offset our starting position and do more rounds (the total number of rounds is the
/// `gcd(left + right, right)` value). The end result is that all elements are finalized once and
/// only once.
///

/// fit onto a stack buffer. The `min(left, right)` elements are copied onto the buffer, `memmove`
/// is applied to the others, and the ones on the buffer are moved back into the hole on the
/// opposite side of where they originated.

/// Algorithms that can be vectorized outperform the above once `left + right` becomes large enough.
/// Algorithm 1 can be vectorized by chunking and performing many rounds at once, but there are too

//!
//! To count the number of characters, we can just count the number of bytes in
//! the string which are not continuation bytes, which can be done many bytes at
//! a time fairly easily.
//!
//! Note: Because the term "leading byte" can sometimes be ambiguous (for
//! example, it could also refer to the first byte of a slice), we'll often use
//! the term "non-continuation byte" to refer to these bytes in the code.

/*
    This is the Two-Way search algorithm, which was introduced in the paper:
    Crochemore, M., Perrin, D., 1991, Two-way string-matching, Journal of the ACM 38(3):651-675.

    Here's some background information.

    A *word* is a string of symbols. The *length* of a word should be a familiar
    notion, and here we denote it for any word x by |x|.
    (We also allow for the possibility of the *empty word*, a word of length zero).

    If x is any non-empty word, then an integer p with 0 < p <= |x| is said to be a
    *period* for x iff for all i with 0 <= i <= |x| - p - 1, we have x[i] == x[i+p].
    For example, both 1 and 2 are periods for the string "aa". As another example,
    the only period of the string "abcd" is 4.

    We denote by period(x) the *smallest* period of x (provided that x is non-empty).
    This is always well-defined since every non-empty word x has at least one period,
    |x|. We sometimes call this *the period* of x.

    If u, v and x are words such that x = uv, where uv is the concatenation of u and
    v, then we say that (u, v) is a *factorization* of x.

    Let (u, v) be a factorization for a word x. Then if w is a non-empty word such
    that both of the following hold

      - either w is a suffix of u or u is a suffix of w
      - either w is a prefix of v or v is a prefix of w

    then w is said to be a *repetition* for the factorization (u, v).

    Just to unpack this, there are four possibilities here. Let w = "abc". Then we
    might have:

      - w is a suffix of u and w is a prefix of v. ex: ("lolabc", "abcde")
      - w is a suffix of u and v is a prefix of w. ex: ("lolabc", "ab")
      - u is a suffix of w and w is a prefix of v. ex: ("bc", "abchi")
      - u is a suffix of w and v is a prefix of w. ex: ("bc", "a")

    Note that the word vu is a repetition for any factorization (u,v) of x = uv,
    so every factorization has at least one repetition.

    If x is a string and (u, v) is a factorization for x, then a *local period* for
    (u, v) is an integer r such that there is some word w such that |w| = r and w is
    a repetition for (u, v).

    We denote by local_period(u, v) the smallest local period of (u, v). We sometimes
    call this *the local period* of (u, v). Provided that x = uv is non-empty, this
    is well-defined (because each non-empty word has at least one factorization, as
    noted above).

    It can be proven that the following is an equivalent definition of a local period
    for a factorization (u, v): any positive integer r such that x[i] == x[i+r] for
    all i such that |u| - r <= i <= |u| - 1 and such that both x[i] and x[i+r] are
    defined. (i.e., i > 0 and i + r < |x|).

    Using the above reformulation, it is easy to prove that

        1 <= local_period(u, v) <= period(uv)

    A factorization (u, v) of x such that local_period(u,v) = period(x) is called a
    *critical factorization*.

    The algorithm hinges on the following theorem, which is stated without proof:

    **Critical Factorization Theorem** Any word x has at least one critical
    factorization (u, v) such that |u| < period(x).

    The purpose of maximal_suffix is to find such a critical factorization.

    If the period is short, compute another factorization x = u' v' to use
    for reverse search, chosen instead so that |v'| < period(x).
