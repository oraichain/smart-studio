//! # The Rust Standard Library
//!
//! The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a
//! set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the [broader Rust
//! ecosystem][crates.io]. It offers core types, like [`Vec<T>`] and
//! [`Option<T>`], library-defined [operations on language
//! primitives](#primitives), [standard macros](#macros), [I/O] and
//! [multithreading], among [many other things][other].
//!
//! `std` is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the
//! standard library can be accessed in [`use`] statements through the path
//! `std`, as in [`use std::env`].
//!
//! # How to read this documentation
//!
//! If you already know the name of what you are looking for, the fastest way to
//! find it is to use the <a href="#" onclick="focusSearchBar();">search
//! bar</a> at the top of the page.
//!
//! Otherwise, you may want to jump to one of these useful sections:
//!
//! * [`std::*` modules](#modules)
//! * [Primitive types](#primitives)
//! * [Standard macros](#macros)
//! * [The Rust Prelude]
//!
//! If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is
//! written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should
//! generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits
//! you don't want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and
//! its documentation!
//!
//! Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may
//! begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your
//! development you may want to press the `[-]` button near the top of the
//! page to collapse it into a more skimmable view.
//!
//! While you are looking at that `[-]` button also notice the `[src]`
//! button. Rust's API documentation comes with the source code and you are
//! encouraged to read it. The standard library source is generally high
//! quality and a peek behind the curtains is often enlightening.
//!
//! # What is in the standard library documentation?
//!
//! First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number of focused
//! modules, [all listed further down this page](#modules). These modules are
//! the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged, and they have mighty names
//! like [`std::slice`] and [`std::cmp`]. Modules' documentation typically
//! includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are a smart
//! place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.
//!
//! Second, implicit methods on [primitive types] are documented here. This can
//! be a source of confusion for two reasons:
//!
//! 1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard library
//!    implements methods directly on the primitive types (and it is the only
//!    library that does so), which are [documented in the section on
//!    primitives](#primitives).
//! 2. The standard library exports many modules *with the same name as
//!    primitive types*. These define additional items related to the primitive
//!    type, but not the all-important methods.
//!
//! So for example there is a [page for the primitive type
//! `i32`](primitive::i32) that lists all the methods that can be called on
//! 32-bit integers (very useful), and there is a [page for the module
//! `std::i32`] that documents the constant values [`MIN`] and [`MAX`] (rarely
//! useful).
//!
//! Note the documentation for the primitives [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] (also
//! called 'slice'). Many method calls on [`String`] and [`Vec<T>`] are actually
//! calls to methods on [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] respectively, via [deref
//! coercions][deref-coercions].
//!
//! Third, the standard library defines [The Rust Prelude], a small collection
//! of items - mostly traits - that are imported into every module of every
//! crate. The traits in the prelude are pervasive, making the prelude
//! documentation a good entry point to learning about the library.
//!
//! And finally, the standard library exports a number of standard macros, and
//! [lists them on this page](#macros) (technically, not all of the standard
//! macros are defined by the standard library - some are defined by the
//! compiler - but they are documented here the same). Like the prelude, the
//! standard macros are imported by default into all crates.

//!
//! # A Tour of The Rust Standard Library
//!
//! The rest of this crate documentation is dedicated to pointing out notable
//! features of The Rust Standard Library.
//!
//! ## Containers and collections
//!
//! The [`option`] and [`result`] modules define optional and error-handling
//! types, [`Option<T>`] and [`Result<T, E>`]. The [`iter`] module defines
//! Rust's iterator trait, [`Iterator`], which works with the [`for`] loop to
//! access collections.
//!
//! The standard library exposes three common ways to deal with contiguous
//! regions of memory:
//!
//! * [`Vec<T>`] - A heap-allocated *vector* that is resizable at runtime.
//! * [`[T; N]`][prim@array] - An inline *array* with a fixed size at compile time.
//! * [`[T]`][prim@slice] - A dynamically sized *slice* into any other kind of contiguous
//!   storage, whether heap-allocated or not.
//!
//! Slices can only be handled through some kind of *pointer*, and as such come
//! in many flavors such as:
//!
//! * `&[T]` - *shared slice*
//! * `&mut [T]` - *mutable slice*
//! * [`Box<[T]>`][owned slice] - *owned slice*
//!
//! [`str`], a UTF-8 string slice, is a primitive type, and the standard library
//! defines many methods for it. Rust [`str`]s are typically accessed as
//! immutable references: `&str`. Use the owned [`String`] for building and
//! mutating strings.
//!
//! For converting to strings use the [`format!`] macro, and for converting from
//! strings use the [`FromStr`] trait.
//!
//! Data may be shared by placing it in a reference-counted box or the [`Rc`]
//! type, and if further contained in a [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`], may be mutated
//! as well as shared. Likewise, in a concurrent setting it is common to pair an
//! atomically-reference-counted box, [`Arc`], with a [`Mutex`] to get the same
//! effect.
//!
//! The [`collections`] module defines maps, sets, linked lists and other
//! typical collection types, including the common [`HashMap<K, V>`].
//!
//! ## Platform abstractions and I/O
//!
//! Besides basic data types, the standard library is largely concerned with
//! abstracting over differences in common platforms, most notably Windows and
//! Unix derivatives.
//!
//! Common types of I/O, including [files], [TCP], [UDP], are defined in the
//! [`io`], [`fs`], and [`net`] modules.
//!
//! The [`thread`] module contains Rust's threading abstractions. [`sync`]
//! contains further primitive shared memory types, including [`atomic`] and
//! [`mpsc`], which contains the channel types for message passing.
//!
//! [I/O]: io
//! [`MIN`]: i32::MIN
//! [`MAX`]: i32::MAX

pub mod prelude {
//! # The Rust Prelude
//!
//! Rust comes with a variety of things in its standard library. However, if
//! you had to manually import every single thing that you used, it would be
//! very verbose. But importing a lot of things that a program never uses isn't
//! good either. A balance needs to be struck.
//!
//! The *prelude* is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into
//! every Rust program. It's kept as small as possible, and is focused on
//! things, particularly traits, which are used in almost every single Rust
//! program.
//!
//! # Other preludes
//!
//! Preludes can be seen as a pattern to make using multiple types more
//! convenient. As such, you'll find other preludes in the standard library,
//! such as [`std::io::prelude`]. Various libraries in the Rust ecosystem may
//! also define their own preludes.
//!
//! [`std::io::prelude`]: crate::io::prelude
//!
//! The difference between 'the prelude' and these other preludes is that they
//! are not automatically `use`'d, and must be imported manually. This is still
//! easier than importing all of their constituent components.
//!
//! # Prelude contents
//!
//! The first version of the prelude is used in Rust 2015 and Rust 2018,
//! and lives in [`std::prelude::v1`].
//! [`std::prelude::rust_2015`] and [`std::prelude::rust_2018`] re-export this prelude.
//! It re-exports the following:
//!
//! * <code>[std::marker]::{[Copy], [Send], [Sized], [Sync], [Unpin]}</code>,
//!   marker traits that indicate fundamental properties of types.
//! * <code>[std::ops]::{[Drop], [Fn], [FnMut], [FnOnce]}</code>, various
//!   operations for both destructors and overloading `()`.
//! * <code>[std::mem]::[drop][mem::drop]</code>, a convenience function for explicitly
//!   dropping a value.
//! * <code>[std::boxed]::[Box]</code>, a way to allocate values on the heap.
//! * <code>[std::borrow]::[ToOwned]</code>, the conversion trait that defines
//!   [`to_owned`], the generic method for creating an owned type from a
//!   borrowed type.
//! * <code>[std::clone]::[Clone]</code>, the ubiquitous trait that defines
//!   [`clone`][Clone::clone], the method for producing a copy of a value.
//! * <code>[std::cmp]::{[PartialEq], [PartialOrd], [Eq], [Ord]}</code>, the
//!   comparison traits, which implement the comparison operators and are often
//!   seen in trait bounds.
//! * <code>[std::convert]::{[AsRef], [AsMut], [Into], [From]}</code>, generic
//!   conversions, used by savvy API authors to create overloaded methods.
//! * <code>[std::default]::[Default]</code>, types that have default values.
//! * <code>[std::iter]::{[Iterator], [Extend], [IntoIterator], [DoubleEndedIterator], [ExactSizeIterator]}</code>,
//!   iterators of various
//!   kinds.
//! * <code>[std::option]::[Option]::{[self][Option], [Some], [None]}</code>, a
//!   type which expresses the presence or absence of a value. This type is so
//!   commonly used, its variants are also exported.
//! * <code>[std::result]::[Result]::{[self][Result], [Ok], [Err]}</code>, a type
//!   for functions that may succeed or fail. Like [`Option`], its variants are
//!   exported as well.
//! * <code>[std::string]::{[String], [ToString]}</code>, heap-allocated strings.
//! * <code>[std::vec]::[Vec]</code>, a growable, heap-allocated vector.
//!
//! The prelude used in Rust 2021, [`std::prelude::rust_2021`], includes all of the above,
//! and in addition re-exports:
//!
//! * <code>[std::convert]::{[TryFrom], [TryInto]}</code>,
//! * <code>[std::iter]::[FromIterator]</code>.

#[macro_use]
pub mod thread {
//! Native threads.
//!
//! ## The threading model
//!
//! An executing Rust program consists of a collection of native OS threads,
//! each with their own stack and local state. Threads can be named, and
//! provide some built-in support for low-level synchronization.
//!
//! Communication between threads can be done through
//! [channels], Rust's message-passing types, along with [other forms of thread
//! synchronization](../../std/sync/index.html) and shared-memory data
//! structures. In particular, types that are guaranteed to be
//! threadsafe are easily shared between threads using the
//! atomically-reference-counted container, [`Arc`].
//!
//! Fatal logic errors in Rust cause *thread panic*, during which
//! a thread will unwind the stack, running destructors and freeing
//! owned resources. While not meant as a 'try/catch' mechanism, panics
//! in Rust can nonetheless be caught (unless compiling with `panic=abort`) with
//! [`catch_unwind`](../../std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html) and recovered
//! from, or alternatively be resumed with
//! [`resume_unwind`](../../std/panic/fn.resume_unwind.html). If the panic
//! is not caught the thread will exit, but the panic may optionally be
//! detected from a different thread with [`join`]. If the main thread panics
//! without the panic being caught, the application will exit with a
//! non-zero exit code.
//!
//! When the main thread of a Rust program terminates, the entire program shuts
//! down, even if other threads are still running. However, this module provides
//! convenient facilities for automatically waiting for the termination of a
//! thread (i.e., join).
//!
//! ## Spawning a thread
//!
//! A new thread can be spawned using the [`thread::spawn`][`spawn`] function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, the spawned thread is "detached," which means that there is
//! no way for the program to learn when the spawned thread completes or otherwise
//! terminates.
//!
//! To learn when a thread completes, it is necessary to capture the [`JoinHandle`]
//! object that is returned by the call to [`spawn`], which provides
//! a `join` method that allows the caller to wait for the completion of the
//! spawned thread:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let thread_join_handle = thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! // some work here
//! let res = thread_join_handle.join();
//! ```
//!
//! The [`join`] method returns a [`thread::Result`] containing [`Ok`] of the final
//! value produced by the spawned thread, or [`Err`] of the value given to
//! a call to [`panic!`] if the thread panicked.
//!
//! Note that there is no parent/child relationship between a thread that spawns a
//! new thread and the thread being spawned.  In particular, the spawned thread may or
//! may not outlive the spawning thread, unless the spawning thread is the main thread.
//!
//! ## Configuring threads
//!
//! A new thread can be configured before it is spawned via the [`Builder`] type,
//! which currently allows you to set the name and stack size for the thread:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #![allow(unused_must_use)]
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::Builder::new().name("thread1".to_string()).spawn(move || {
//!     println!("Hello, world!");
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ## The `Thread` type
//!
//! Threads are represented via the [`Thread`] type, which you can get in one of
//! two ways:
//!
//! * By spawning a new thread, e.g., using the [`thread::spawn`][`spawn`]
//!   function, and calling [`thread`][`JoinHandle::thread`] on the [`JoinHandle`].
//! * By requesting the current thread, using the [`thread::current`] function.
//!
//! The [`thread::current`] function is available even for threads not spawned
//! by the APIs of this module.
//!
//! ## Thread-local storage
//!
//! This module also provides an implementation of thread-local storage for Rust
//! programs. Thread-local storage is a method of storing data into a global
//! variable that each thread in the program will have its own copy of.
//! Threads do not share this data, so accesses do not need to be synchronized.
//!
//! A thread-local key owns the value it contains and will destroy the value when the
//! thread exits. It is created with the [`thread_local!`] macro and can contain any
//! value that is `'static` (no borrowed pointers). It provides an accessor function,
//! [`with`], that yields a shared reference to the value to the specified
//! closure. Thread-local keys allow only shared access to values, as there would be no
//! way to guarantee uniqueness if mutable borrows were allowed. Most values
//! will want to make use of some form of **interior mutability** through the
//! [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`] types.
//!
//! ## Naming threads
//!
//! Threads are able to have associated names for identification purposes. By default, spawned
//! threads are unnamed. To specify a name for a thread, build the thread with [`Builder`] and pass
//! the desired thread name to [`Builder::name`]. To retrieve the thread name from within the
//! thread, use [`Thread::name`]. A couple examples of where the name of a thread gets used:
//!
//! * If a panic occurs in a named thread, the thread name will be printed in the panic message.
//! * The thread name is provided to the OS where applicable (e.g., `pthread_setname_np` in
//!   unix-like platforms).
//!
//! ## Stack size
//!
//! The default stack size for spawned threads is 2 MiB, though this particular stack size is
//! subject to change in the future. There are two ways to manually specify the stack size for
//! spawned threads:
//!
//! * Build the thread with [`Builder`] and pass the desired stack size to [`Builder::stack_size`].
//! * Set the `RUST_MIN_STACK` environment variable to an integer representing the desired stack
//!   size (in bytes). Note that setting [`Builder::stack_size`] will override this.
//!
//! Note that the stack size of the main thread is *not* determined by Rust.

//! A backtrace is typically quite handy to attach to errors (e.g. types
//! implementing `std::error::Error`) to get a causal chain of where an error
//! was generated.
//!
//! > **Note**: this module is unstable and is designed in [RFC 2504], and you
//! > can learn more about its status in the [tracking issue].
//!
//! [RFC 2504]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2504-fix-error.md
//! [tracking issue]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53487
//!
//! ## Accuracy
//!
//! Backtraces are attempted to be as accurate as possible, but no guarantees
//! are provided about the exact accuracy of a backtrace. Instruction pointers,
//! symbol names, filenames, line numbers, etc, may all be incorrect when
//! reported. Accuracy is attempted on a best-effort basis, however, and bugs
//! are always welcome to indicate areas of improvement!
//!
//! For most platforms a backtrace with a filename/line number requires that
//! programs be compiled with debug information. Without debug information
//! filenames/line numbers will not be reported.
//!
//! ## Platform support
//!
//! Not all platforms that libstd compiles for support capturing backtraces.
//! Some platforms simply do nothing when capturing a backtrace. To check
//! whether the platform supports capturing backtraces you can consult the
//! `BacktraceStatus` enum as a result of `Backtrace::status`.
//!
//! Like above with accuracy platform support is done on a best effort basis.
//! Sometimes libraries might not be available at runtime or something may go
//! wrong which would cause a backtrace to not be captured. Please feel free to
//! report issues with platforms where a backtrace cannot be captured though!
//!
//! ## Environment Variables
//!
//! The `Backtrace::capture` function might not actually capture a backtrace by
//! default. Its behavior is governed by two environment variables:
//!
//! * `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE` - if this is set to `0` then `Backtrace::capture`
//!   will never capture a backtrace. Any other value this is set to will enable
//!   `Backtrace::capture`.
//!
//! * `RUST_BACKTRACE` - if `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE` is not set, then this variable
//!   is consulted with the same rules of `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE`.
//!
//! * If neither of the above env vars are set, then `Backtrace::capture` will
//!   be disabled.
//!
//! Capturing a backtrace can be a quite expensive runtime operation, so the
//! environment variables allow either forcibly disabling this runtime
//! performance hit or allow selectively enabling it in some programs.
//!
//! Note that the `Backtrace::force_capture` function can be used to ignore
//! these environment variables. Also note that the state of environment
//! variables is cached once the first backtrace is created, so altering
//! `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE` or `RUST_BACKTRACE` at runtime might not actually change
//! how backtraces are captured.

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
}

// NB: A note on resolution of a backtrace:
//
// Backtraces primarily happen in two steps, one is where we actually capture
// the stack backtrace, giving us a list of instruction pointers corresponding
// to stack frames. Next we take these instruction pointers and, one-by-one,
// turn them into a human readable name (like `main`).
//
// The first phase can be somewhat expensive (walking the stack), especially
// on MSVC where debug information is consulted to return inline frames each as
// their own frame. The second phase, however, is almost always extremely
// expensive (on the order of milliseconds sometimes) when it's consulting debug
// information.
//
// We attempt to amortize this cost as much as possible by delaying resolution
// of an address to a human readable name for as long as possible. When
// `Backtrace::create` is called to capture a backtrace it doesn't actually
// perform any symbol resolution, but rather we lazily resolve symbols only just
// before they're needed for printing. This way we can make capturing a
// backtrace and throwing it away much cheaper, but actually printing a
// backtrace is still basically the same cost.
//
// This strategy comes at the cost of some synchronization required inside of a
// `Backtrace`, but that's a relatively small price to pay relative to capturing
// a backtrace or actually symbolizing it.

// Originally, the `Error` trait was defined in libcore, and the impls
// were scattered about. However, coherence objected to this

// knowing that `&str: !Error`, and we have no means to deal with that
// sort of conflict just now. Therefore, for the time being, we have
// moved the `Error` trait into libstd. As we evolve a sol'n to the

//! Utilities related to FFI bindings.
//!
//! This module provides utilities to handle data across non-Rust
//! interfaces, like other programming languages and the underlying
//! operating system. It is mainly of use for FFI (Foreign Function
//! Interface) bindings and code that needs to exchange C-like strings
//! with other languages.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Rust represents owned strings with the [`String`] type, and
//! borrowed slices of strings with the [`str`] primitive. Both are
//! always in UTF-8 encoding, and may contain nul bytes in the middle,
//! i.e., if you look at the bytes that make up the string, there may
//! be a `\0` among them. Both `String` and `str` store their length
//! explicitly; there are no nul terminators at the end of strings
//! like in C.
//!
//! C strings are different from Rust strings:
//!
//! * **Encodings** - Rust strings are UTF-8, but C strings may use
//! other encodings. If you are using a string from C, you should
//! check its encoding explicitly, rather than just assuming that it
//! is UTF-8 like you can do in Rust.
//!
//! * **Character size** - C strings may use `char` or `wchar_t`-sized
//! characters; please **note** that C's `char` is different from Rust's.
//! The C standard leaves the actual sizes of those types open to
//! interpretation, but defines different APIs for strings made up of
//! each character type. Rust strings are always UTF-8, so different
//! Unicode characters will be encoded in a variable number of bytes
//! each. The Rust type [`char`] represents a '[Unicode scalar
//! value]', which is similar to, but not the same as, a '[Unicode
//! code point]'.
//!
//! * **Nul terminators and implicit string lengths** - Often, C
//! strings are nul-terminated, i.e., they have a `\0` character at the
//! end. The length of a string buffer is not stored, but has to be
//! calculated; to compute the length of a string, C code must
//! manually call a function like `strlen()` for `char`-based strings,
//! or `wcslen()` for `wchar_t`-based ones. Those functions return
//! the number of characters in the string excluding the nul
//! terminator, so the buffer length is really `len+1` characters.
//! Rust strings don't have a nul terminator; their length is always
//! stored and does not need to be calculated. While in Rust
//! accessing a string's length is an *O*(1) operation (because the
//! length is stored); in C it is an *O*(*n*) operation because the
//! length needs to be computed by scanning the string for the nul
//! terminator.
//!
//! * **Internal nul characters** - When C strings have a nul
//! terminator character, this usually means that they cannot have nul
//! characters in the middle — a nul character would essentially
//! truncate the string. Rust strings *can* have nul characters in
//! the middle, because nul does not have to mark the end of the
//! string in Rust.
//!
//! # Representations of non-Rust strings
//!
//! [`CString`] and [`CStr`] are useful when you need to transfer
//! UTF-8 strings to and from languages with a C ABI, like Python.
//!
//! * **From Rust to C:** [`CString`] represents an owned, C-friendly
//! string: it is nul-terminated, and has no internal nul characters.
//! Rust code can create a [`CString`] out of a normal string (provided
//! that the string doesn't have nul characters in the middle), and
//! then use a variety of methods to obtain a raw <code>\*mut [u8]</code> that can
//! then be passed as an argument to functions which use the C
//! conventions for strings.
//!
//! * **From C to Rust:** [`CStr`] represents a borrowed C string; it
//! is what you would use to wrap a raw <code>\*const [u8]</code> that you got from
//! a C function. A [`CStr`] is guaranteed to be a nul-terminated array
//! of bytes. Once you have a [`CStr`], you can convert it to a Rust
//! <code>&[str]</code> if it's valid UTF-8, or lossily convert it by adding
//! replacement characters.
//!
//! [`OsString`] and [`OsStr`] are useful when you need to transfer
//! strings to and from the operating system itself, or when capturing
//! the output of external commands. Conversions between [`OsString`],
//! [`OsStr`] and Rust strings work similarly to those for [`CString`]
//! and [`CStr`].
//!
//! * [`OsString`] represents an owned string in whatever
//! representation the operating system prefers. In the Rust standard
//! library, various APIs that transfer strings to/from the operating
//! system use [`OsString`] instead of plain strings. For example,
//! [`env::var_os()`] is used to query environment variables; it
//! returns an <code>[Option]<[OsString]></code>. If the environment variable
//! exists you will get a <code>[Some]\(os_string)</code>, which you can
//! *then* try to convert to a Rust string. This yields a [`Result`], so that
//! your code can detect errors in case the environment variable did
//! not in fact contain valid Unicode data.
//!
//! * [`OsStr`] represents a borrowed reference to a string in a
//! format that can be passed to the operating system. It can be
//! converted into a UTF-8 Rust string slice in a similar way to
//! [`OsString`].
//!
//! # Conversions
//!
//! ## On Unix
//!
//! On Unix, [`OsStr`] implements the
//! <code>std::os::unix::ffi::[OsStrExt][unix.OsStrExt]</code> trait, which
//! augments it with two methods, [`from_bytes`] and [`as_bytes`].
//! These do inexpensive conversions from and to UTF-8 byte slices.
//!
//! Additionally, on Unix [`OsString`] implements the
//! <code>std::os::unix::ffi::[OsStringExt][unix.OsStringExt]</code> trait,
//! which provides [`from_vec`] and [`into_vec`] methods that consume
//! their arguments, and take or produce vectors of [`u8`].
//!
//! ## On Windows
//!
//! On Windows, [`OsStr`] implements the
//! <code>std::os::windows::ffi::[OsStrExt][windows.OsStrExt]</code> trait,
//! which provides an [`encode_wide`] method. This provides an
//! iterator that can be [`collect`]ed into a vector of [`u16`].
//!
//! Additionally, on Windows [`OsString`] implements the
//! <code>std::os::windows:ffi::[OsStringExt][windows.OsStringExt]</code>
//! trait, which provides a [`from_wide`] method. The result of this
//! method is an [`OsString`] which can be round-tripped to a Windows
//! string losslessly.

///
/// `CString` is to <code>&[CStr]</code> as [`String`] is to <code>&[str]</code>: the former

///
/// The [`CString::new`] method will actually check that the provided <code>&[[u8]]</code>
/// does not have 0 bytes in the middle, and return an error if it
/// finds one.
///
/// # Extracting a raw pointer to the whole C string
///
/// `CString` implements an [`as_ptr`][`CStr::as_ptr`] method through the [`Deref`]
/// trait. This method will give you a `*const c_char` which you can
/// feed directly to extern functions that expect a nul-terminated
/// string, like C's `strdup()`. Notice that [`as_ptr`][`CStr::as_ptr`] returns a
/// read-only pointer; if the C code writes to it, that causes
/// undefined behavior.
///
/// # Extracting a slice of the whole C string
///
/// Alternatively, you can obtain a <code>&[[u8]]</code> slice from a
/// `CString` with the [`CString::as_bytes`] method. Slices produced in this
/// way do *not* contain the trailing nul terminator. This is useful
/// when you will be calling an extern function that takes a `*const
/// u8` argument which is not necessarily nul-terminated, plus another

/// The need for this type arises from the fact that:
///
/// * On Unix systems, strings are often arbitrary sequences of non-zero
///   bytes, in many cases interpreted as UTF-8.
///
/// * On Windows, strings are often arbitrary sequences of non-zero 16-bit
///   values, interpreted as UTF-16 when it is valid to do so.
///
/// * In Rust, strings are always valid UTF-8, which may contain zeros.
///
/// `OsString` and [`OsStr`] bridge this gap by simultaneously representing Rust
/// and platform-native string values, and in particular allowing a Rust string
/// to be converted into an "OS" string with no cost if possible. A consequence
/// of this is that `OsString` instances are *not* `NUL` terminated; in order
/// to pass to e.g., Unix system call, you should create a [`CStr`].
///
/// `OsString` is to <code>&[OsStr]</code> as [`String`] is to <code>&[str]</code>: the former
/// in each pair are owned strings; the latter are borrowed
/// references.
///
/// Note, `OsString` and [`OsStr`] internally do not necessarily hold strings in
/// the form native to the platform; While on Unix, strings are stored as a
/// sequence of 8-bit values, on Windows, where strings are 16-bit value based
/// as just discussed, strings are also actually stored as a sequence of 8-bit
/// values, encoded in a less-strict variant of UTF-8. This is useful to
/// understand when handling capacity and length values.
///
/// # Creating an `OsString`
///
/// **From a Rust string**: `OsString` implements
/// <code>[From]<[String]></code>, so you can use <code>my_string.[into]\()</code> to
/// create an `OsString` from a normal Rust string.
///
/// **From slices:** Just like you can start with an empty Rust
/// [`String`] and then [`String::push_str`] some <code>&[str]</code>
/// sub-string slices into it, you can create an empty `OsString` with
/// the [`OsString::new`] method and then push string slices into it with the
/// [`OsString::push`] method.
///
/// # Extracting a borrowed reference to the whole OS string
///
/// You can use the [`OsString::as_os_str`] method to get an <code>&[OsStr]</code> from
/// an `OsString`; this is effectively a borrowed reference to the
/// whole string.

//! Traits, helpers, and type definitions for core I/O functionality.
//!
//! The `std::io` module contains a number of common things you'll need
//! when doing input and output. The most core part of this module is
//! the [`Read`] and [`Write`] traits, which provide the
//! most general interface for reading and writing input and output.
//!
//! # Read and Write
//!
//! Because they are traits, [`Read`] and [`Write`] are implemented by a number
//! of other types, and you can implement them for your types too. As such,
//! you'll see a few different types of I/O throughout the documentation in
//! this module: [`File`]s, [`TcpStream`]s, and sometimes even [`Vec<T>`]s. For
//! example, [`Read`] adds a [`read`][`Read::read`] method, which we can use on
//! [`File`]s:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! [`Read`] and [`Write`] are so important, implementors of the two traits have a
//! nickname: readers and writers. So you'll sometimes see 'a reader' instead
//! of 'a type that implements the [`Read`] trait'. Much easier!
//!
//! ## Seek and BufRead
//!
//! Beyond that, there are two important traits that are provided: [`Seek`]
//! and [`BufRead`]. Both of these build on top of a reader to control
//! how the reading happens. [`Seek`] lets you control where the next byte is
//! coming from:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::SeekFrom;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! [`BufRead`] uses an internal buffer to provide a number of other ways to read, but
//! to show it off, we'll need to talk about buffers in general. Keep reading!
//!
//! ## BufReader and BufWriter
//!
//! Byte-based interfaces are unwieldy and can be inefficient, as we'd need to be
//! making near-constant calls to the operating system. To help with this,
//! `std::io` comes with two structs, [`BufReader`] and [`BufWriter`], which wrap
//! readers and writers. The wrapper uses a buffer, reducing the number of
//! calls and providing nicer methods for accessing exactly what you want.
//!
//! For example, [`BufReader`] works with the [`BufRead`] trait to add extra
//! methods to any reader:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::BufReader;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! [`BufWriter`] doesn't add any new ways of writing; it just buffers every call
//! to [`write`][`Write::write`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::BufWriter;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Standard input and output
//!
//! A very common source of input is standard input:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! Note that you cannot use the [`?` operator] in functions that do not return
//! a [`Result<T, E>`][`Result`]. Instead, you can call [`.unwrap()`]
//! or `match` on the return value to catch any possible errors:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//!
//! let mut input = String::new();
//!
//! io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! And a very common source of output is standard output:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! Of course, using [`io::stdout`] directly is less common than something like
//! [`println!`].
//!
//! ## Iterator types
//!
//! A large number of the structures provided by `std::io` are for various
//! ways of iterating over I/O. For example, [`Lines`] is used to split over
//! lines:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//! use std::io::prelude::*;
//! use std::io::BufReader;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! There are a number of [functions][functions-list] that offer access to various
//! features. For example, we can use three of these functions to copy everything
//! from standard input to standard output:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::io;
//!
//! fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! [functions-list]: #functions-1
//!
//! ## io::Result
//!
//! Last, but certainly not least, is [`io::Result`]. This type is used
//! as the return type of many `std::io` functions that can cause an error, and
//! can be returned from your own functions as well. Many of the examples in this
//! module use the [`?` operator]:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::io;
//!
//! fn read_input() -> io::Result<()> {
}
//! ```
//!
//! The return type of `read_input()`, [`io::Result<()>`][`io::Result`], is a very
//! common type for functions which don't have a 'real' return value, but do want to
//! return errors if they happen. In this case, the only purpose of this function is
//! to read the line and print it, so we use `()`.
//!
//! ## Platform-specific behavior
//!
//! Many I/O functions throughout the standard library are documented to indicate
//! what various library or syscalls they are delegated to. This is done to help
//! applications both understand what's happening under the hood as well as investigate
//! any possibly unclear semantics. Note, however, that this is informative, not a binding
//! contract. The implementation of many of these functions are subject to change over
//! time and may call fewer or more syscalls/library functions.
//!
//! [`File`]: crate::fs::File
//! [`TcpStream`]: crate::net::TcpStream
//! [`io::stdout`]: stdout
//! [`io::Result`]: self::Result
//! [`?` operator]: ../../book/appendix-02-operators.html
//! [`Result`]: crate::result::Result
//! [`.unwrap()`]: crate::result::Result::unwrap

// 2. We're passing a raw buffer to the function `f`, and it is expected that

/// A trait for objects which can be converted or resolved to one or more

///
/// This trait is used for generic address resolution when constructing network
/// objects. By default it is implemented for the following types:
///
///  * [`SocketAddr`]: [`to_socket_addrs`] is the identity function.
///
///  * [`SocketAddrV4`], [`SocketAddrV6`], <code>([IpAddr], [u16])</code>,
///    <code>([Ipv4Addr], [u16])</code>, <code>([Ipv6Addr], [u16])</code>:
///    [`to_socket_addrs`] constructs a [`SocketAddr`] trivially.
///
///  * <code>(&[str], [u16])</code>: <code>&[str]</code> should be either a string representation
///    of an [`IpAddr`] address as expected by [`FromStr`] implementation or a host
///    name. [`u16`] is the port number.
///
///  * <code>&[str]</code>: the string should be either a string representation of a
///    [`SocketAddr`] as expected by its [`FromStr`] implementation or a string like
///    `<host_name>:<port>` pair where `<port>` is a [`u16`] value.
///
/// This trait allows constructing network objects like [`TcpStream`] or
/// [`UdpSocket`] easily with values of various types for the bind/connection
/// address. It is needed because sometimes one type is more appropriate than
/// the other: for simple uses a string like `"localhost:12345"` is much nicer
/// than manual construction of the corresponding [`SocketAddr`], but sometimes
/// [`SocketAddr`] value is *the* main source of the address, and converting it to
/// some other type (e.g., a string) just for it to be converted back to
/// [`SocketAddr`] in constructor methods is pointless.
///
/// Addresses returned by the operating system that are not IP addresses are
/// silently ignored.

/// system.
///
/// [IETF RFC 4291]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291
///
/// # Embedding IPv4 Addresses
///
/// See [`IpAddr`] for a type encompassing both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
///
/// To assist in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 two types of IPv6 addresses that embed an IPv4 address were defined:
/// IPv4-compatible and IPv4-mapped addresses. Of these IPv4-compatible addresses have been officially deprecated.
///
/// Both types of addresses are not assigned any special meaning by this implementation,
/// other than what the relevant standards prescribe. This means that an address like `::ffff:127.0.0.1`,
/// while representing an IPv4 loopback address, is not itself an IPv6 loopback address; only `::1` is.
/// To handle these so called "IPv4-in-IPv6" addresses, they have to first be converted to their canonical IPv4 address.
///
/// ### IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Addresses
///
/// IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses are defined in [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.1], and have been officially deprecated.
/// The RFC describes the format of an "IPv4-Compatible IPv6 address" as follows:
///
/// ```text
/// |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
/// +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
/// |0000..............................0000|0000|    IPv4 address     |
/// +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+
/// ```
/// So `::a.b.c.d` would be an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address representing the IPv4 address `a.b.c.d`.
///
/// To convert from an IPv4 address to an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address, use [`Ipv4Addr::to_ipv6_compatible`].
/// Use [`Ipv6Addr::to_ipv4`] to convert an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address to the canonical IPv4 address.
///
/// [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.1
///
/// ### IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Addresses
///
/// IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses are defined in [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.2].
/// The RFC describes the format of an "IPv4-Mapped IPv6 address" as follows:
///
/// ```text
/// |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
/// +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
/// |0000..............................0000|FFFF|    IPv4 address     |
/// +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+
/// ```
/// So `::ffff:a.b.c.d` would be an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address representing the IPv4 address `a.b.c.d`.
///
/// To convert from an IPv4 address to an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, use [`Ipv4Addr::to_ipv6_mapped`].
/// Use [`Ipv6Addr::to_ipv4`] to convert an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address to the canonical IPv4 address.
///
/// [IETF RFC 4291 Section 2.5.5.2]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.2
///
/// # Textual representation
///
/// `Ipv6Addr` provides a [`FromStr`] implementation. There are many ways to represent
/// an IPv6 address in text, but in general, each segments is written in hexadecimal
/// notation, and segments are separated by `:`. For more information, see
/// [IETF RFC 5952].

//! Unix-specific extensions to general I/O primitives.
//!
//! Just like raw pointers, raw file descriptors point to resources with
//! dynamic lifetimes, and they can dangle if they outlive their resources
//! or be forged if they're created from invalid values.
//!
//! This module provides three types for representing file descriptors,
//! with different ownership properties: raw, borrowed, and owned, which are
//! analogous to types used for representing pointers:
//!
//! | Type               | Analogous to |
//! | ------------------ | ------------ |
//! | [`RawFd`]          | `*const _`   |
//! | [`BorrowedFd<'a>`] | `&'a _`      |
//! | [`OwnedFd`]        | `Box<_>`     |
//!
//! Like raw pointers, `RawFd` values are primitive values. And in new code,
//! they should be considered unsafe to do I/O on (analogous to dereferencing
//! them). Rust did not always provide this guidance, so existing code in the
//! Rust ecosystem often doesn't mark `RawFd` usage as unsafe. Once the
//! `io_safety` feature is stable, libraries will be encouraged to migrate,
//! either by adding `unsafe` to APIs that dereference `RawFd` values, or by
//! using to `BorrowedFd` or `OwnedFd` instead.
//!
//! Like references, `BorrowedFd` values are tied to a lifetime, to ensure
//! that they don't outlive the resource they point to. These are safe to
//! use. `BorrowedFd` values may be used in APIs which provide safe access to
//! any system call except for:
//!  - `close`, because that would end the dynamic lifetime of the resource
//!    without ending the lifetime of the file descriptor.
//!  - `dup2`/`dup3`, in the second argument, because this argument is
//!    closed and assigned a new resource, which may break the assumptions
//!    other code using that file descriptor.
//! This list doesn't include `mmap`, since `mmap` does do a proper borrow of
//! its file descriptor argument. That said, `mmap` is unsafe for other
//! reasons: it operates on raw pointers, and it can have undefined behavior if
//! the underlying storage is mutated. Mutations may come from other processes,
//! or from the same process if the API provides `BorrowedFd` access, since as
//! mentioned earlier, `BorrowedFd` values may be used in APIs which provide
//! safe access to any system call. Consequently, code using `mmap` and
//! presenting a safe API must take full responsibility for ensuring that safe
//! Rust code cannot evoke undefined behavior through it.
//!
//! Like boxes, `OwnedFd` values conceptually own the resource they point to,
//! and free (close) it when they are dropped.
//!

//! Windows-specific extensions to primitives in the [`std::ffi`] module.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! For historical reasons, the Windows API uses a form of potentially
//! ill-formed UTF-16 encoding for strings. Specifically, the 16-bit
//! code units in Windows strings may contain [isolated surrogate code
//! points which are not paired together][ill-formed-utf-16]. The
//! Unicode standard requires that surrogate code points (those in the
//! range U+D800 to U+DFFF) always be *paired*, because in the UTF-16
//! encoding a *surrogate code unit pair* is used to encode a single
//! character. For compatibility with code that does not enforce
//! these pairings, Windows does not enforce them, either.
//!
//! While it is not always possible to convert such a string losslessly into
//! a valid UTF-16 string (or even UTF-8), it is often desirable to be
//! able to round-trip such a string from and to Windows APIs
//! losslessly. For example, some Rust code may be "bridging" some
//! Windows APIs together, just passing `WCHAR` strings among those
//! APIs without ever really looking into the strings.
//!
//! If Rust code *does* need to look into those strings, it can
//! convert them to valid UTF-8, possibly lossily, by substituting
//! invalid sequences with [`U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`][U+FFFD], as is
//! conventionally done in other Rust APIs that deal with string
//! encodings.
//!
//! # `OsStringExt` and `OsStrExt`
//!
//! [`OsString`] is the Rust wrapper for owned strings in the
//! preferred representation of the operating system. On Windows,
//! this struct gets augmented with an implementation of the
//! [`OsStringExt`] trait, which has an [`OsStringExt::from_wide`] method. This
//! lets you create an [`OsString`] from a `&[u16]` slice; presumably
//! you get such a slice out of a `WCHAR` Windows API.
//!
//! Similarly, [`OsStr`] is the Rust wrapper for borrowed strings from
//! preferred representation of the operating system. On Windows, the
//! [`OsStrExt`] trait provides the [`OsStrExt::encode_wide`] method, which
//! outputs an [`EncodeWide`] iterator. You can [`collect`] this
//! iterator, for example, to obtain a `Vec<u16>`; you can later get a
//! pointer to this vector's contents and feed it to Windows APIs.
//!
//! These traits, along with [`OsString`] and [`OsStr`], work in
//! conjunction so that it is possible to **round-trip** strings from
//! Windows and back, with no loss of data, even if the strings are
//! ill-formed UTF-16.
//!

//! Windows-specific extensions to general I/O primitives.

//! Just like raw pointers, raw Windows handles and sockets point to resources
//! with dynamic lifetimes, and they can dangle if they outlive their resources
//! or be forged if they're created from invalid values.
//!
//! This module provides three types for representing raw handles and sockets
//! with different ownership properties: raw, borrowed, and owned, which are
//! analogous to types used for representing pointers:
//!
//! | Type                   | Analogous to |
//! | ---------------------- | ------------ |
//! | [`RawHandle`]          | `*const _`   |
//! | [`RawSocket`]          | `*const _`   |
//! |                        |              |
//! | [`BorrowedHandle<'a>`] | `&'a _`      |
//! | [`BorrowedSocket<'a>`] | `&'a _`      |
//! |                        |              |
//! | [`OwnedHandle`]        | `Box<_>`     |
//! | [`OwnedSocket`]        | `Box<_>`     |
//!
//! Like raw pointers, `RawHandle` and `RawSocket` values are primitive values.
//! And in new code, they should be considered unsafe to do I/O on (analogous
//! to dereferencing them). Rust did not always provide this guidance, so
//! existing code in the Rust ecosystem often doesn't mark `RawHandle` and
//! `RawSocket` usage as unsafe. Once the `io_safety` feature is stable,
//! libraries will be encouraged to migrate, either by adding `unsafe` to APIs
//! that dereference `RawHandle` and `RawSocket` values, or by using to
//! `BorrowedHandle`, `BorrowedSocket`, `OwnedHandle`, or `OwnedSocket`.
//!
//! Like references, `BorrowedHandle` and `BorrowedSocket` values are tied to a
//! lifetime, to ensure that they don't outlive the resource they point to.
//! These are safe to use. `BorrowedHandle` and `BorrowedSocket` values may be
//! used in APIs which provide safe access to any system call except for
//! `CloseHandle`, `closesocket`, or any other call that would end the
//! dynamic lifetime of the resource without ending the lifetime of the
//! handle or socket.
//!
//! Like boxes, `OwnedHandle` and `OwnedSocket` values conceptually own the
//! resource they point to, and free (close) it when they are dropped.
//!

//! Cross-platform path manipulation.
//!
//! This module provides two types, [`PathBuf`] and [`Path`] (akin to [`String`]
//! and [`str`]), for working with paths abstractly. These types are thin wrappers
//! around [`OsString`] and [`OsStr`] respectively, meaning that they work directly
//! on strings according to the local platform's path syntax.
//!
//! Paths can be parsed into [`Component`]s by iterating over the structure
//! returned by the [`components`] method on [`Path`]. [`Component`]s roughly
//! correspond to the substrings between path separators (`/` or `\`). You can
//! reconstruct an equivalent path from components with the [`push`] method on
//! [`PathBuf`]; note that the paths may differ syntactically by the
//! normalization described in the documentation for the [`components`] method.
//!
//! ## Simple usage
//!
//! Path manipulation includes both parsing components from slices and building
//! new owned paths.
//!
//! To parse a path, you can create a [`Path`] slice from a [`str`]
//! slice and start asking questions:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::path::Path;
//! use std::ffi::OsStr;
//!
//! let path = Path::new("/tmp/foo/bar.txt");
//!
//! let parent = path.parent();
//! assert_eq!(parent, Some(Path::new("/tmp/foo")));
//!
//! let file_stem = path.file_stem();
//! assert_eq!(file_stem, Some(OsStr::new("bar")));
//!
//! let extension = path.extension();
//! assert_eq!(extension, Some(OsStr::new("txt")));
//! ```
//!
//! To build or modify paths, use [`PathBuf`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//!
//! // This way works...
//! let mut path = PathBuf::from("c:\\");
//!
//! path.push("windows");
//! path.push("system32");
//!
//! path.set_extension("dll");
//!
//! // ... but push is best used if you don't know everything up
//! // front. If you do, this way is better:
//! let path: PathBuf = ["c:\\", "windows", "system32.dll"].iter().collect();
//! ```
//!
//! [`components`]: Path::components
//! [`push`]: PathBuf::push

// GENERAL NOTES
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// Parsing in this module is done by directly transmuting OsStr to [u8] slices,
// taking advantage of the fact that OsStr always encodes ASCII characters
// as-is.  Eventually, this transmutation should be replaced by direct uses of
// OsStr APIs for parsing, but it will take a while for those to become
// available.

pub mod process {
//! A module for working with processes.
//!
//! This module is mostly concerned with spawning and interacting with child
//! processes, but it also provides [`abort`] and [`exit`] for terminating the
//! current process.
//!
//! # Spawning a process
//!
//! The [`Command`] struct is used to configure and spawn processes:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::process::Command;
//!
//! let output = Command::new("echo")
//!                      .arg("Hello world")
//!                      .output()
//!                      .expect("Failed to execute command");
//!
//! assert_eq!(b"Hello world\n", output.stdout.as_slice());
//! ```
//!
//! Several methods on [`Command`], such as [`spawn`] or [`output`], can be used
//! to spawn a process. In particular, [`output`] spawns the child process and
//! waits until the process terminates, while [`spawn`] will return a [`Child`]
//! that represents the spawned child process.
//!
//! # Handling I/O
//!
//! The [`stdout`], [`stdin`], and [`stderr`] of a child process can be
//! configured by passing an [`Stdio`] to the corresponding method on
//! [`Command`]. Once spawned, they can be accessed from the [`Child`]. For
//! example, piping output from one command into another command can be done
//! like so:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
//!
//! // stdout must be configured with `Stdio::piped` in order to use
//! // `echo_child.stdout`
//! let echo_child = Command::new("echo")
//!     .arg("Oh no, a tpyo!")
//!     .stdout(Stdio::piped())
//!     .spawn()
//!     .expect("Failed to start echo process");
//!
//! // Note that `echo_child` is moved here, but we won't be needing
//! // `echo_child` anymore
//! let echo_out = echo_child.stdout.expect("Failed to open echo stdout");
//!
//! let mut sed_child = Command::new("sed")
//!     .arg("s/tpyo/typo/")
//!     .stdin(Stdio::from(echo_out))
//!     .stdout(Stdio::piped())
//!     .spawn()
//!     .expect("Failed to start sed process");
//!
//! let output = sed_child.wait_with_output().expect("Failed to wait on sed");
//! assert_eq!(b"Oh no, a typo!\n", output.stdout.as_slice());
//! ```
//!
//! Note that [`ChildStderr`] and [`ChildStdout`] implement [`Read`] and
//! [`ChildStdin`] implements [`Write`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
//! use std::io::Write;
//!
//! let mut child = Command::new("/bin/cat")
//!     .stdin(Stdio::piped())
//!     .stdout(Stdio::piped())
//!     .spawn()
//!     .expect("failed to execute child");
//!
//! // If the child process fills its stdout buffer, it may end up
//! // waiting until the parent reads the stdout, and not be able to
//! // read stdin in the meantime, causing a deadlock.
//! // Writing from another thread ensures that stdout is being read
//! // at the same time, avoiding the problem.
//! let mut stdin = child.stdin.take().expect("failed to get stdin");
//! std::thread::spawn(move || {
//!     stdin.write_all(b"test").expect("failed to write to stdin");
//! });
//!
//! let output = child
//!     .wait_with_output()
//!     .expect("failed to wait on child");
//!
//! assert_eq!(b"test", output.stdout.as_slice());
//! ```

///
/// There is no implementation of [`Drop`] for child processes,

/// # Warning
///
/// On some systems, calling [`wait`] or similar is necessary for the OS to

pub mod sync {
//! Useful synchronization primitives.
//!
//! ## The need for synchronization
//!
//! Conceptually, a Rust program is a series of operations which will
//! be executed on a computer. The timeline of events happening in the
//! program is consistent with the order of the operations in the code.
//!
//! Consider the following code, operating on some global static variables:
//!
//! ```rust
//! static mut A: u32 = 0;
//! static mut B: u32 = 0;
//! static mut C: u32 = 0;
//!
//! fn main() {
}
//! ```
//!
//! It appears as if some variables stored in memory are changed, an addition
//! is performed, result is stored in `A` and the variable `C` is
//! modified twice.
//!
//! When only a single thread is involved, the results are as expected:
//! the line `7 4 4` gets printed.
//!
//! As for what happens behind the scenes, when optimizations are enabled the
//! final generated machine code might look very different from the code:
//!
//! - The first store to `C` might be moved before the store to `A` or `B`,
//!   _as if_ we had written `C = 4; A = 3; B = 4`.
//!
//! - Assignment of `A + B` to `A` might be removed, since the sum can be stored
//!   in a temporary location until it gets printed, with the global variable
//!   never getting updated.
//!
//! - The final result could be determined just by looking at the code
//!   at compile time, so [constant folding] might turn the whole
//!   block into a simple `println!("7 4 4")`.
//!
//! The compiler is allowed to perform any combination of these
//! optimizations, as long as the final optimized code, when executed,
//! produces the same results as the one without optimizations.
//!
//! Due to the [concurrency] involved in modern computers, assumptions
//! about the program's execution order are often wrong. Access to
//! global variables can lead to nondeterministic results, **even if**
//! compiler optimizations are disabled, and it is **still possible**
//! to introduce synchronization bugs.
//!
//! Note that thanks to Rust's safety guarantees, accessing global (static)
//! variables requires `unsafe` code, assuming we don't use any of the
//! synchronization primitives in this module.
//!
//! [constant folding]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding
//! [concurrency]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)
//!
//! ## Out-of-order execution
//!
//! Instructions can execute in a different order from the one we define, due to
//! various reasons:
//!
//! - The **compiler** reordering instructions: If the compiler can issue an
//!   instruction at an earlier point, it will try to do so. For example, it
//!   might hoist memory loads at the top of a code block, so that the CPU can
//!   start [prefetching] the values from memory.
//!
//!   In single-threaded scenarios, this can cause issues when writing
//!   signal handlers or certain kinds of low-level code.
//!   Use [compiler fences] to prevent this reordering.
//!
//! - A **single processor** executing instructions [out-of-order]:
//!   Modern CPUs are capable of [superscalar] execution,
//!   i.e., multiple instructions might be executing at the same time,
//!   even though the machine code describes a sequential process.
//!
//!   This kind of reordering is handled transparently by the CPU.
//!
//! - A **multiprocessor** system executing multiple hardware threads
//!   at the same time: In multi-threaded scenarios, you can use two
//!   kinds of primitives to deal with synchronization:
//!   - [memory fences] to ensure memory accesses are made visible to
//!   other CPUs in the right order.
//!   - [atomic operations] to ensure simultaneous access to the same
//!   memory location doesn't lead to undefined behavior.
//!
//! [prefetching]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_prefetching
//! [compiler fences]: crate::sync::atomic::compiler_fence
//! [out-of-order]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution
//! [superscalar]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscalar_processor
//! [memory fences]: crate::sync::atomic::fence
//! [atomic operations]: crate::sync::atomic
//!
//! ## Higher-level synchronization objects
//!
//! Most of the low-level synchronization primitives are quite error-prone and
//! inconvenient to use, which is why the standard library also exposes some
//! higher-level synchronization objects.
//!
//! These abstractions can be built out of lower-level primitives.
//! For efficiency, the sync objects in the standard library are usually
//! implemented with help from the operating system's kernel, which is
//! able to reschedule the threads while they are blocked on acquiring
//! a lock.
//!
//! The following is an overview of the available synchronization
//! objects:
//!
//! - [`Arc`]: Atomically Reference-Counted pointer, which can be used
//!   in multithreaded environments to prolong the lifetime of some
//!   data until all the threads have finished using it.
//!
//! - [`Barrier`]: Ensures multiple threads will wait for each other
//!   to reach a point in the program, before continuing execution all
//!   together.
//!
//! - [`Condvar`]: Condition Variable, providing the ability to block
//!   a thread while waiting for an event to occur.
//!
//! - [`mpsc`]: Multi-producer, single-consumer queues, used for
//!   message-based communication. Can provide a lightweight
//!   inter-thread synchronisation mechanism, at the cost of some
//!   extra memory.
//!
//! - [`Mutex`]: Mutual Exclusion mechanism, which ensures that at
//!   most one thread at a time is able to access some data.
//!
//! - [`Once`]: Used for thread-safe, one-time initialization of a
//!   global variable.
//!
//! - [`RwLock`]: Provides a mutual exclusion mechanism which allows
//!   multiple readers at the same time, while allowing only one
//!   writer at a time. In some cases, this can be more efficient than
//!   a mutex.
//!
//! [`Arc`]: crate::sync::Arc
//! [`Barrier`]: crate::sync::Barrier
//! [`Condvar`]: crate::sync::Condvar
//! [`mpsc`]: crate::sync::mpsc
//! [`Mutex`]: crate::sync::Mutex
//! [`Once`]: crate::sync::Once
//! [`RwLock`]: crate::sync::RwLock

pub mod mpsc {
//! Multi-producer, single-consumer FIFO queue communication primitives.
//!
//! This module provides message-based communication over channels, concretely
//! defined among three types:
//!
//! * [`Sender`]
//! * [`SyncSender`]
//! * [`Receiver`]
//!
//! A [`Sender`] or [`SyncSender`] is used to send data to a [`Receiver`]. Both
//! senders are clone-able (multi-producer) such that many threads can send
//! simultaneously to one receiver (single-consumer).
//!
//! These channels come in two flavors:
//!
//! 1. An asynchronous, infinitely buffered channel. The [`channel`] function
//!    will return a `(Sender, Receiver)` tuple where all sends will be
//!    **asynchronous** (they never block). The channel conceptually has an
//!    infinite buffer.
//!
//! 2. A synchronous, bounded channel. The [`sync_channel`] function will
//!    return a `(SyncSender, Receiver)` tuple where the storage for pending
//!    messages is a pre-allocated buffer of a fixed size. All sends will be
//!    **synchronous** by blocking until there is buffer space available. Note
//!    that a bound of 0 is allowed, causing the channel to become a "rendezvous"
//!    channel where each sender atomically hands off a message to a receiver.
//!
//! [`send`]: Sender::send
//!
//! ## Disconnection
//!
//! The send and receive operations on channels will all return a [`Result`]
//! indicating whether the operation succeeded or not. An unsuccessful operation
//! is normally indicative of the other half of a channel having "hung up" by
//! being dropped in its corresponding thread.
//!
//! Once half of a channel has been deallocated, most operations can no longer
//! continue to make progress, so [`Err`] will be returned. Many applications
//! will continue to [`unwrap`] the results returned from this module,
//! instigating a propagation of failure among threads if one unexpectedly dies.
//!
//! [`unwrap`]: Result::unwrap
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Simple usage:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::thread;
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//!
//! // Create a simple streaming channel
//! let (tx, rx) = channel();
//! thread::spawn(move|| {
//!     tx.send(10).unwrap();
//! });
//! assert_eq!(rx.recv().unwrap(), 10);
//! ```
//!
//! Shared usage:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::thread;
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//!
//! // Create a shared channel that can be sent along from many threads
//! // where tx is the sending half (tx for transmission), and rx is the receiving
//! // half (rx for receiving).
//! let (tx, rx) = channel();
//! for i in 0..10 {
//!     let tx = tx.clone();
//!     thread::spawn(move|| {
//!         tx.send(i).unwrap();
//!     });
//! }
//!
//! for _ in 0..10 {
//!     let j = rx.recv().unwrap();
//!     assert!(0 <= j && j < 10);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Propagating panics:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//!
//! // The call to recv() will return an error because the channel has already
//! // hung up (or been deallocated)
//! let (tx, rx) = channel::<i32>();
//! drop(tx);
//! assert!(rx.recv().is_err());
//! ```
//!
//! Synchronous channels:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::thread;
//! use std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = sync_channel::<i32>(0);
//! thread::spawn(move|| {
//!     // This will wait for the parent thread to start receiving
//!     tx.send(53).unwrap();
//! });
//! rx.recv().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Unbounded receive loop:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel;
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = sync_channel(3);
//!
//! for _ in 0..3 {
//!     // It would be the same without thread and clone here
//!     // since there will still be one `tx` left.
//!     let tx = tx.clone();
//!     // cloned tx dropped within thread
//!     thread::spawn(move || tx.send("ok").unwrap());
//! }
//!
//! // Drop the last sender to stop `rx` waiting for message.
//! // The program will not complete if we comment this out.
//! // **All** `tx` needs to be dropped for `rx` to have `Err`.
//! drop(tx);
//!
//! // Unbounded receiver waiting for all senders to complete.
//! while let Ok(msg) = rx.recv() {
//!     println!("{}", msg);
//! }
//!
//! println!("completed");
//! ```

// A description of how Rust's channel implementation works
//
// Channels are supposed to be the basic building block for all other
// concurrent primitives that are used in Rust. As a result, the channel type
// needs to be highly optimized, flexible, and broad enough for use everywhere.
//
// The choice of implementation of all channels is to be built on lock-free data
// structures. The channels themselves are then consequently also lock-free data
// structures. As always with lock-free code, this is a very "here be dragons"
// territory, especially because I'm unaware of any academic papers that have
// gone into great length about channels of these flavors.
//
// ## Flavors of channels
//
// From the perspective of a consumer of this library, there is only one flavor
// of channel. This channel can be used as a stream and cloned to allow multiple
// senders. Under the hood, however, there are actually three flavors of
// channels in play.
//
// * Flavor::Oneshots - these channels are highly optimized for the one-send use
//                      case. They contain as few atomics as possible and
//                      involve one and exactly one allocation.
// * Streams - these channels are optimized for the non-shared use case. They
//             use a different concurrent queue that is more tailored for this
//             use case. The initial allocation of this flavor of channel is not
//             optimized.
// * Shared - this is the most general form of channel that this module offers,
//            a channel with multiple senders. This type is as optimized as it
//            can be, but the previous two types mentioned are much faster for
//            their use-cases.
//
// ## Concurrent queues
//
// The basic idea of Rust's Sender/Receiver types is that send() never blocks,
// but recv() obviously blocks. This means that under the hood there must be
// some shared and concurrent queue holding all of the actual data.
//
// With two flavors of channels, two flavors of queues are also used. We have
// chosen to use queues from a well-known author that are abbreviated as SPSC
// and MPSC (single producer, single consumer and multiple producer, single
// consumer). SPSC queues are used for streams while MPSC queues are used for
// shared channels.
//
// ### SPSC optimizations
//
// The SPSC queue found online is essentially a linked list of nodes where one
// half of the nodes are the "queue of data" and the other half of nodes are a
// cache of unused nodes. The unused nodes are used such that an allocation is
// not required on every push() and a free doesn't need to happen on every
// pop().
//
// As found online, however, the cache of nodes is of an infinite size. This
// means that if a channel at one point in its life had 50k items in the queue,
// then the queue will always have the capacity for 50k items. I believed that
// this was an unnecessary limitation of the implementation, so I have altered
// the queue to optionally have a bound on the cache size.
//
// By default, streams will have an unbounded SPSC queue with a small-ish cache
// size. The hope is that the cache is still large enough to have very fast
// send() operations while not too large such that millions of channels can
// coexist at once.
//
// ### MPSC optimizations
//
// Right now the MPSC queue has not been optimized. Like the SPSC queue, it uses
// a linked list under the hood to earn its unboundedness, but I have not put
// forth much effort into having a cache of nodes similar to the SPSC queue.
//
// For now, I believe that this is "ok" because shared channels are not the most
// common type, but soon we may wish to revisit this queue choice and determine
// another candidate for backend storage of shared channels.
//
// ## Overview of the Implementation
//
// Now that there's a little background on the concurrent queues used, it's
// worth going into much more detail about the channels themselves. The basic
// pseudocode for a send/recv are:
//
//
//      send(t)                             recv()
//        queue.push(t)                       return if queue.pop()
//        if increment() == -1                deschedule {
//          wakeup()                            if decrement() > 0
//                                                cancel_deschedule()
//                                            }
//                                            queue.pop()
//
// As mentioned before, there are no locks in this implementation, only atomic
// instructions are used.
//
// ### The internal atomic counter
//
// Every channel has a shared counter with each half to keep track of the size
// of the queue. This counter is used to abort descheduling by the receiver and
// to know when to wake up on the sending side.
//
// As seen in the pseudocode, senders will increment this count and receivers
// will decrement the count. The theory behind this is that if a sender sees a
// -1 count, it will wake up the receiver, and if the receiver sees a 1+ count,
// then it doesn't need to block.
//
// The recv() method has a beginning call to pop(), and if successful, it needs
// to decrement the count. It is a crucial implementation detail that this
// decrement does *not* happen to the shared counter. If this were the case,
// then it would be possible for the counter to be very negative when there were
// no receivers waiting, in which case the senders would have to determine when
// it was actually appropriate to wake up a receiver.
//
// Instead, the "steal count" is kept track of separately (not atomically
// because it's only used by receivers), and then the decrement() call when
// descheduling will lump in all of the recent steals into one large decrement.
//
// The implication of this is that if a sender sees a -1 count, then there's
// guaranteed to be a waiter waiting!
//
// ## Native Implementation
//
// A major goal of these channels is to work seamlessly on and off the runtime.
// All of the previous race conditions have been worded in terms of
// scheduler-isms (which is obviously not available without the runtime).
//
// For now, native usage of channels (off the runtime) will fall back onto
// mutexes/cond vars for descheduling/atomic decisions. The no-contention path
// is still entirely lock-free, the "deschedule" blocks above are surrounded by
// a mutex and the "wakeup" blocks involve grabbing a mutex and signaling on a
// condition variable.
//
// ## Select
//
// Being able to support selection over channels has greatly influenced this
// design, and not only does selection need to work inside the runtime, but also
// outside the runtime.
//
// The implementation is fairly straightforward. The goal of select() is not to
// return some data, but only to return which channel can receive data without
// blocking. The implementation is essentially the entire blocking procedure
// followed by an increment as soon as its woken up. The cancellation procedure
// involves an increment and swapping out of to_wake to acquire ownership of the
// thread to unblock.
//
// Sadly this current implementation requires multiple allocations, so I have
// seen the throughput of select() be much worse than it should be. I do not
// believe that there is anything fundamental that needs to change about these
// channels, however, in order to support a more efficient select().
//
// FIXME: Select is now removed, so these factors are ready to be cleaned up!
//
// # Conclusion
//
// And now that you've seen all the races that I found and attempted to fix,
// here's the code for you to find some more!

/// A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data
///
/// This mutex will block threads waiting for the lock to become available. The
/// mutex can also be statically initialized or created via a [`new`]
/// constructor. Each mutex has a type parameter which represents the data that
/// it is protecting. The data can only be accessed through the RAII guards
/// returned from [`lock`] and [`try_lock`], which guarantees that the data is only
/// ever accessed when the mutex is locked.
///
/// # Poisoning
///
/// The mutexes in this module implement a strategy called "poisoning" where a
/// mutex is considered poisoned whenever a thread panics while holding the
/// mutex. Once a mutex is poisoned, all other threads are unable to access the
/// data by default as it is likely tainted (some invariant is not being
/// upheld).
///
/// For a mutex, this means that the [`lock`] and [`try_lock`] methods return a
/// [`Result`] which indicates whether a mutex has been poisoned or not. Most
/// usage of a mutex will simply [`unwrap()`] these results, propagating panics
/// among threads to ensure that a possibly invalid invariant is not witnessed.
///
/// A poisoned mutex, however, does not prevent all access to the underlying
/// data. The [`PoisonError`] type has an [`into_inner`] method which will return
/// the guard that would have otherwise been returned on a successful lock. This
/// allows access to the data, despite the lock being poisoned.
///

/// // let the main thread know once all increments are done.
/// //
/// // Here we're using an Arc to share memory among threads, and the data inside
/// // the Arc is protected with a mutex.
/// let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
///
/// let (tx, rx) = channel();

///     thread::spawn(move || {
///         // The shared state can only be accessed once the lock is held.
///         // Our non-atomic increment is safe because we're the only thread
///         // which can access the shared state when the lock is held.
///         //
///         // We unwrap() the return value to assert that we are not expecting

mod once {
//! A "once initialization" primitive
//!
//! This primitive is meant to be used to run one-time initialization. An
//! example use case would be for initializing an FFI library.

// A "once" is a relatively simple primitive, and it's also typically provided
// by the OS as well (see `pthread_once` or `InitOnceExecuteOnce`). The OS
// primitives, however, tend to have surprising restrictions, such as the Unix
// one doesn't allow an argument to be passed to the function.
//
// As a result, we end up implementing it ourselves in the standard library.
// This also gives us the opportunity to optimize the implementation a bit which
// should help the fast path on call sites. Consequently, let's explain how this
// primitive works now!
//
// So to recap, the guarantees of a Once are that it will call the
// initialization closure at most once, and it will never return until the one
// that's running has finished running. This means that we need some form of
// blocking here while the custom callback is running at the very least.
// Additionally, we add on the restriction of **poisoning**. Whenever an
// initialization closure panics, the Once enters a "poisoned" state which means
// that all future calls will immediately panic as well.
//
// So to implement this, one might first reach for a `Mutex`, but those cannot
// be put into a `static`. It also gets a lot harder with poisoning to figure
// out when the mutex needs to be deallocated because it's not after the closure
// finishes, but after the first successful closure finishes.
//
// All in all, this is instead implemented with atomics and lock-free
// operations! Whee! Each `Once` has one word of atomic state, and this state is
// CAS'd on to determine what to do. There are four possible state of a `Once`:
//
// * Incomplete - no initialization has run yet, and no thread is currently
//                using the Once.
// * Poisoned - some thread has previously attempted to initialize the Once, but
//              it panicked, so the Once is now poisoned. There are no other
//              threads currently accessing this Once.
// * Running - some thread is currently attempting to run initialization. It may
//             succeed, so all future threads need to wait for it to finish.
//             Note that this state is accompanied with a payload, described
//             below.
// * Complete - initialization has completed and all future calls should finish
//              immediately.
//
// With 4 states we need 2 bits to encode this, and we use the remaining bits
// in the word we have allocated as a queue of threads waiting for the thread
// responsible for entering the RUNNING state. This queue is just a linked list
// of Waiter nodes which is monotonically increasing in size. Each node is
// allocated on the stack, and whenever the running closure finishes it will
// consume the entire queue and notify all waiters they should try again.
//
// You'll find a few more details in the implementation, but that's the gist of
// it!
//
// Atomic orderings:
// When running `Once` we deal with multiple atomics:
// `Once.state_and_queue` and an unknown number of `Waiter.signaled`.
// * `state_and_queue` is used (1) as a state flag, (2) for synchronizing the
//   result of the `Once`, and (3) for synchronizing `Waiter` nodes.
//     - At the end of the `call_inner` function we have to make sure the result
//       of the `Once` is acquired. So every load which can be the only one to
//       load COMPLETED must have at least Acquire ordering, which means all
//       three of them.
//     - `WaiterQueue::Drop` is the only place that may store COMPLETED, and
//       must do so with Release ordering to make the result available.
//     - `wait` inserts `Waiter` nodes as a pointer in `state_and_queue`, and
//       needs to make the nodes available with Release ordering. The load in
//       its `compare_exchange` can be Relaxed because it only has to compare
//       the atomic, not to read other data.
//     - `WaiterQueue::Drop` must see the `Waiter` nodes, so it must load
//       `state_and_queue` with Acquire ordering.
//     - There is just one store where `state_and_queue` is used only as a
//       state flag, without having to synchronize data: switching the state
//       from INCOMPLETE to RUNNING in `call_inner`. This store can be Relaxed,
//       but the read has to be Acquire because of the requirements mentioned
//       above.
// * `Waiter.signaled` is both used as a flag, and to protect a field with
//   interior mutability in `Waiter`. `Waiter.thread` is changed in
//   `WaiterQueue::Drop` which then sets `signaled` with Release ordering.
//   After `wait` loads `signaled` with Acquire and sees it is true, it needs to
//   see the changes to drop the `Waiter` struct correctly.
// * There is one place where the two atomics `Once.state_and_queue` and
//   `Waiter.signaled` come together, and might be reordered by the compiler or
//   processor. Because both use Acquire ordering such a reordering is not
//   allowed, so no need for SeqCst.

/// `read`, e.g.:
///
/// <details><summary>Potential deadlock example</summary>
///
/// ```text
/// // Thread 1             |  // Thread 2
/// let _rg = lock.read();  |
///                         |  // will block
///                         |  let _wg = lock.write();
/// // may deadlock         |
/// let _rg = lock.read();  |
/// ```
/// </details>
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that `T` satisfies [`Send`] to be shared across threads and
/// [`Sync`] to allow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards
/// returned from the locking methods implement [`Deref`] (and [`DerefMut`]
/// for the `write` methods) to allow access to the content of the lock.
///
/// # Poisoning
///
/// An `RwLock`, like [`Mutex`], will become poisoned on a panic. Note, however,
/// that an `RwLock` may only be poisoned if a panic occurs while it is locked
/// exclusively (write mode). If a panic occurs in any reader, then the lock
/// will not be poisoned.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::RwLock;
///
/// let lock = RwLock::new(5);
///
/// // many reader locks can be held at once
/// {
///     let r1 = lock.read().unwrap();
///     let r2 = lock.read().unwrap();
///     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
/// } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
/// // only one write lock may be held, however
/// {
///     let mut w = lock.write().unwrap();
///     *w += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
/// } // write lock is dropped here

/// Note, however, that instants are not guaranteed to be **steady**. In other

///
/// Instants are opaque types that can only be compared to one another. There is

/// allows measuring the duration between two instants (or comparing two
/// instants).
///
/// The size of an `Instant` struct may vary depending on the target operating
/// system.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
/// use std::thread::sleep;
///
/// fn main() {
///    let now = Instant::now();
///
///    // we sleep for 2 seconds
///    sleep(Duration::new(2, 0));
///    // it prints '2'
///    println!("{}", now.elapsed().as_secs());
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # OS-specific behaviors
///
/// An `Instant` is a wrapper around system-specific types and it may behave
/// differently depending on the underlying operating system. For example,
/// the following snippet is fine on Linux but panics on macOS:
///
/// ```no_run

///
/// fn main() {

//! OS-based thread local storage
//!
//! This module provides an implementation of OS-based thread local storage,
//! using the native OS-provided facilities (think `TlsAlloc` or
//! `pthread_setspecific`). The interface of this differs from the other types
//! of thread-local-storage provided in this crate in that OS-based TLS can only
//! get/set pointer-sized data, possibly with an associated destructor.
//!
//! This module also provides two flavors of TLS. One is intended for static
//! initialization, and does not contain a `Drop` implementation to deallocate
//! the OS-TLS key. The other is a type which does implement `Drop` and hence
//! has a safe interface.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This module should likely not be used directly unless other primitives are
//! being built on. Types such as `thread_local::spawn::Key` are likely much
//! more useful in practice than this OS-based version which likely requires
//! unsafe code to interoperate with.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Using a dynamically allocated TLS key. Note that this key can be shared
//! among many threads via an `Arc`.
//!
//! ```ignore (cannot-doctest-private-modules)
//! let key = Key::new(None);
//! assert!(key.get().is_null());
//! key.set(1 as *mut u8);
//! assert!(!key.get().is_null());
//!
//! drop(key); // deallocate this TLS slot.
//! ```
//!
//! Sometimes a statically allocated key is either required or easier to work
//! with, however.
//!
//! ```ignore (cannot-doctest-private-modules)
//! static KEY: StaticKey = INIT;
//!
//! unsafe {
//!     assert!(KEY.get().is_null());
//!     KEY.set(1 as *mut u8);
//! }

//! like the `String` and `&str` types do for UTF-8.
//!
//! Since [WTF-8 must not be used
//! for interchange](https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/#intended-audience),
//! this library deliberately does not provide access to the underlying bytes
//! of WTF-8 strings,
//! nor can it decode WTF-8 from arbitrary bytes.
//! WTF-8 strings can be obtained from UTF-8, UTF-16, or code points.

// this module is imported from @SimonSapin's repo and has tons of dead code on
// unix (it's mostly used on windows), so don't worry about dead code here.

mod backtrace_rs {
//! A library for acquiring a backtrace at runtime
//!
//! This library is meant to supplement the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` support of the
//! standard library by allowing an acquisition of a backtrace at runtime
//! programmatically. The backtraces generated by this library do not need to be
//! parsed, for example, and expose the functionality of multiple backend
//! implementations.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! First, add this to your Cargo.toml
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! backtrace = "0.3"
//! ```
//!
//! Next:
//!
//! ```
//! fn main() {
}
//! ```
//!
//! # Backtrace accuracy
//!
//! This crate implements best-effort attempts to get the native backtrace. This
//! is not always guaranteed to work, and some platforms don't return any
//! backtrace at all. If your application requires accurate backtraces then it's
//! recommended to closely evaluate this crate to see whether it's suitable
//! for your use case on your target platforms.
//!
//! Even on supported platforms, there's a number of reasons that backtraces may
//! be less-than-accurate, including but not limited to:
//!
//! * Unwind information may not be available. This crate primarily implements
//!   backtraces by unwinding the stack, but not all functions may have
//!   unwinding information (e.g. DWARF unwinding information).
//!
//! * Rust code may be compiled without unwinding information for some
//!   functions. This can also happen for Rust code compiled with
//!   `-Cpanic=abort`. You can remedy this, however, with
//!   `-Cforce-unwind-tables` as a compiler option.
//!
//! * Unwind information may be inaccurate or corrupt. In the worst case
//!   inaccurate unwind information can lead this library to segfault. In the
//!   best case inaccurate information will result in a truncated stack trace.
//!
//! * Backtraces may not report filenames/line numbers correctly due to missing
//!   or corrupt debug information. This won't lead to segfaults unlike corrupt
//!   unwinding information, but missing or malformed debug information will
//!   mean that filenames and line numbers will not be available. This may be
//!   because debug information wasn't generated by the compiler, or it's just
//!   missing on the filesystem.
//!
//! * Not all platforms are supported. For example there's no way to get a
//!   backtrace on WebAssembly at the moment.
//!
//! * Crate features may be disabled. Currently this crate supports using Gimli
//!   libbacktrace on non-Windows platforms for reading debuginfo for
//!   backtraces. If both crate features are disabled, however, then these
//!   platforms will generate a backtrace but be unable to generate symbols for
//!   it.
//!
//! In most standard workflows for most standard platforms you generally don't
//! need to worry about these caveats. We'll try to fix ones where we can over
//! time, but otherwise it's important to be aware of the limitations of
//! unwinding-based backtraces!
