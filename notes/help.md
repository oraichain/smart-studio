## Privacy Notice

Updated on Mar 15, 2021

The Oraichain Studio has a client-server architecture. Some of the functionality resides on servers, which means that the application might send user source files to the servers and back. This information is temporarily stored on servers, but will not be shared with general public.

The Oraichain Studio provides functionality to share user files with the public (via the Share or Fork action). The shared information cannot be made private once shared. The application may use third-party storage for storing this information.

The Oraichain Studio may track its usage through telemetry. We use this information to improve user experience. This information is not made publicly available.
